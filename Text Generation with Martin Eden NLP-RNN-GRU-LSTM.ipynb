      "The one opened the door with a latch-key and went in, followed by a\n",
      "young fellow who awkwardly removed his cap. He wore rough clothes that\n",
      "smacked of the sea, and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious\n",
      "hall in which he found himself. He did not know what to do with his\n",
      "cap, and was stuffing it into his coat pocket when the other took it\n",
      "from him. The act was done quietly and naturally, and the awkward young\n",
      "fellow appreciated it. “He understands,” was his thought. “He’ll see me\n",
      "through all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked at the other’s heels with a swing to his shoulders, and his\n",
      "legs spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting up and\n",
      "sinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea. The wide rooms seemed\n",
      "too narrow for his rolling gait, and to himself he was in terror lest\n",
      "his broad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the\n",
      "bric-a-brac from the low mantel. He recoiled from side to side between\n",
      "the various objects and multiplied the hazards that in reality lodged\n",
      "only in his mind. Between a grand piano and a centre-table piled high\n",
      "with books was space for a half a dozen to walk abreast, yet he essayed\n",
      "it with trepidation. His heavy arms hung loosely at his sides. He did\n",
      "not know what to do with those arms and hands, and when, to his excited\n",
      "vision, one arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table,\n",
      "he lurched away like a frightened horse, barely missing the piano\n",
      "stool. He watched the easy walk of the other in front of him, and for\n",
      "the first time realized that his walk was different from that of other\n",
      "men. He experienced a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so\n",
      "uncouthly. The sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny\n",
      "beads, and he paused and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on, Arthur, my boy,” he said, attempting to mask his anxiety with\n",
      "facetious utterance. “This is too much all at once for yours truly.\n",
      "Give me a chance to get my nerve. You know I didn’t want to come, an’ I\n",
      "guess your fam’ly ain’t hankerin’ to see me neither.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s all right,” was the reassuring answer. “You mustn’t be\n",
      "frightened at us. We’re just homely people—Hello, there’s a letter for\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped back to the table, tore open the envelope, and began to\n",
      "read, giving the stranger an opportunity to recover himself. And the\n",
      "stranger understood and appreciated. His was the gift of sympathy,\n",
      "understanding; and beneath his alarmed exterior that sympathetic\n",
      "process went on. He mopped his forehead dry and glanced about him with\n",
      "a controlled face, though in the eyes there was an expression such as\n",
      "wild animals betray when they fear the trap. He was surrounded by the\n",
      "unknown, apprehensive of what might happen, ignorant of what he should\n",
      "do, aware that he walked and bore himself awkwardly, fearful that every\n",
      "attribute and power of him was similarly afflicted. He was keenly\n",
      "sensitive, hopelessly self-conscious, and the amused glance that the\n",
      "other stole privily at him over the top of the letter burned into him\n",
      "like a dagger-thrust. He saw the glance, but he gave no sign, for among\n",
      "the things he had learned was discipline. Also, that dagger-thrust went\n",
      "to his pride. He cursed himself for having come, and at the same time\n",
      "resolved that, happen what would, having come, he would carry it\n",
      "through. The lines of his face hardened, and into his eyes came a\n",
      "fighting light. He looked about more unconcernedly, sharply observant,\n",
      "every detail of the pretty interior registering itself on his brain.\n",
      "His eyes were wide apart; nothing in their field of vision escaped; and\n",
      "as they drank in the beauty before them the fighting light died out and\n",
      "a warm glow took its place. He was responsive to beauty, and here was\n",
      "cause to respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "An oil painting caught and held him. A heavy surf thundered and burst\n",
      "over an outjutting rock; lowering storm-clouds covered the sky; and,\n",
      "outside the line of surf, a pilot-schooner, close-hauled, heeled over\n",
      "till every detail of her deck was visible, was surging along against a\n",
      "stormy sunset sky. There was beauty, and it drew him irresistibly. He\n",
      "forgot his awkward walk and came closer to the painting, very close.\n",
      "The beauty faded out of the canvas. His face expressed his\n",
      "bepuzzlement. He stared at what seemed a careless daub of paint, then\n",
      "stepped away. Immediately all the beauty flashed back into the canvas.\n",
      "“A trick picture,” was his thought, as he dismissed it, though in the\n",
      "midst of the multitudinous impressions he was receiving he found time\n",
      "to feel a prod of indignation that so much beauty should be sacrificed\n",
      "to make a trick. He did not know painting. He had been brought up on\n",
      "chromos and lithographs that were always definite and sharp, near or\n",
      "far. He had seen oil paintings, it was true, in the show windows of\n",
      "shops, but the glass of the windows had prevented his eager eyes from\n",
      "approaching too near.\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced around at his friend reading the letter and saw the books on\n",
      "the table. Into his eyes leaped a wistfulness and a yearning as\n",
      "promptly as the yearning leaps into the eyes of a starving man at sight\n",
      "of food. An impulsive stride, with one lurch to right and left of the\n",
      "shoulders, brought him to the table, where he began affectionately\n",
      "handling the books. He glanced at the titles and the authors’ names,\n",
      "read fragments of text, caressing the volumes with his eyes and hands,\n",
      "and, once, recognized a book he had read. For the rest, they were\n",
      "strange books and strange authors. He chanced upon a volume of\n",
      "Swinburne and began reading steadily, forgetful of where he was, his\n",
      "face glowing. Twice he closed the book on his forefinger to look at the\n",
      "name of the author. Swinburne! he would remember that name. That fellow\n",
      "had eyes, and he had certainly seen color and flashing light. But who\n",
      "was Swinburne? Was he dead a hundred years or so, like most of the\n",
      "poets? Or was he alive still, and writing? He turned to the title-page\n",
      ". . . yes, he had written other books; well, he would go to the free\n",
      "library the first thing in the morning and try to get hold of some of\n",
      "Swinburne’s stuff. He went back to the text and lost himself. He did\n",
      "not notice that a young woman had entered the room. The first he knew\n",
      "was when he heard Arthur’s voice saying:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ruth, this is Mr. Eden.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The book was closed on his forefinger, and before he turned he was\n",
      "thrilling to the first new impression, which was not of the girl, but\n",
      "of her brother’s words. Under that muscled body of his he was a mass of\n",
      "quivering sensibilities. At the slightest impact of the outside world\n",
      "upon his consciousness, his thoughts, sympathies, and emotions leapt\n",
      "and played like lambent flame. He was extraordinarily receptive and\n",
      "responsive, while his imagination, pitched high, was ever at work\n",
      "establishing relations of likeness and difference. “Mr. Eden,” was what\n",
      "he had thrilled to—he who had been called “Eden,” or “Martin Eden,” or\n",
      "just “Martin,” all his life. And “_Mister_!” It was certainly going\n",
      "some, was his internal comment. His mind seemed to turn, on the\n",
      "instant, into a vast camera obscura, and he saw arrayed around his\n",
      "consciousness endless pictures from his life, of stoke-holes and\n",
      "forecastles, camps and beaches, jails and boozing-kens, fever-hospitals\n",
      "and slum streets, wherein the thread of association was the fashion in\n",
      "which he had been addressed in those various situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he turned and saw the girl. The phantasmagoria of his brain\n",
      "vanished at sight of her. She was a pale, ethereal creature, with wide,\n",
      "spiritual blue eyes and a wealth of golden hair. He did not know how\n",
      "she was dressed, except that the dress was as wonderful as she. He\n",
      "likened her to a pale gold flower upon a slender stem. No, she was a\n",
      "spirit, a divinity, a goddess; such sublimated beauty was not of the\n",
      "earth. Or perhaps the books were right, and there were many such as she\n",
      "in the upper walks of life. She might well be sung by that chap,\n",
      "Swinburne. Perhaps he had had somebody like her in mind when he painted\n",
      "that girl, Iseult, in the book there on the table. All this plethora of\n",
      "sight, and feeling, and thought occurred on the instant. There was no\n",
      "pause of the realities wherein he moved. He saw her hand coming out to\n",
      "his, and she looked him straight in the eyes as she shook hands,\n",
      "frankly, like a man. The women he had known did not shake hands that\n",
      "way. For that matter, most of them did not shake hands at all. A flood\n",
      "of associations, visions of various ways he had made the acquaintance\n",
      "of women, rushed into his mind and threatened to swamp it. But he shook\n",
      "them aside and looked at her. Never had he seen such a woman. The women\n",
      "he had known! Immediately, beside her, on either hand, ranged the women\n",
      "he had known. For an eternal second he stood in the midst of a portrait\n",
      "gallery, wherein she occupied the central place, while about her were\n",
      "limned many women, all to be weighed and measured by a fleeting glance,\n",
      "herself the unit of weight and measure. He saw the weak and sickly\n",
      "faces of the girls of the factories, and the simpering, boisterous\n",
      "girls from the south of Market. There were women of the cattle camps,\n",
      "and swarthy cigarette-smoking women of Old Mexico. These, in turn, were\n",
      "crowded out by Japanese women, doll-like, stepping mincingly on wooden\n",
      "clogs; by Eurasians, delicate featured, stamped with degeneracy; by\n",
      "full-bodied South-Sea-Island women, flower-crowned and brown-skinned.\n",
      "All these were blotted out by a grotesque and terrible nightmare\n",
      "brood—frowsy, shuffling creatures from the pavements of Whitechapel,\n",
      "gin-bloated hags of the stews, and all the vast hell’s following of\n",
      "harpies, vile-mouthed and filthy, that under the guise of monstrous\n",
      "female form prey upon sailors, the scrapings of the ports, the scum and\n",
      "slime of the human pit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Won’t you sit down, Mr. Eden?” the girl was saying. “I have been\n",
      "looking forward to meeting you ever since Arthur told us. It was brave\n",
      "of you—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He waved his hand deprecatingly and muttered that it was nothing at\n",
      "all, what he had done, and that any fellow would have done it. She\n",
      "noticed that the hand he waved was covered with fresh abrasions, in the\n",
      "process of healing, and a glance at the other loose-hanging hand showed\n",
      "it to be in the same condition. Also, with quick, critical eye, she\n",
      "noted a scar on his cheek, another that peeped out from under the hair\n",
      "of the forehead, and a third that ran down and disappeared under the\n",
      "starched collar. She repressed a smile at sight of the red line that\n",
      "marked the chafe of the collar against the bronzed neck. He was\n",
      "evidently unused to stiff collars. Likewise her feminine eye took in\n",
      "the clothes he wore, the cheap and unaesthetic cut, the wrinkling of\n",
      "the coat across the shoulders, and the series of wrinkles in the\n",
      "sleeves that advertised bulging biceps muscles.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he waved his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at all,\n",
      "he was obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair. He found time\n",
      "to admire the ease with which she sat down, then lurched toward a chair\n",
      "facing her, overwhelmed with consciousness of the awkward figure he was\n",
      "cutting. This was a new experience for him. All his life, up to then,\n",
      "he had been unaware of being either graceful or awkward. Such thoughts\n",
      "of self had never entered his mind. He sat down gingerly on the edge of\n",
      "the chair, greatly worried by his hands. They were in the way wherever\n",
      "he put them. Arthur was leaving the room, and Martin Eden followed his\n",
      "exit with longing eyes. He felt lost, alone there in the room with that\n",
      "pale spirit of a woman. There was no bar-keeper upon whom to call for\n",
      "drinks, no small boy to send around the corner for a can of beer and by\n",
      "means of that social fluid start the amenities of friendship flowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have such a scar on your neck, Mr. Eden,” the girl was saying.\n",
      "“How did it happen? I am sure it must have been some adventure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A Mexican with a knife, miss,” he answered, moistening his parched\n",
      "lips and clearing his throat. “It was just a fight. After I got the\n",
      "knife away, he tried to bite off my nose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Baldly as he had stated it, in his eyes was a rich vision of that hot,\n",
      "starry night at Salina Cruz, the white strip of beach, the lights of\n",
      "the sugar steamers in the harbor, the voices of the drunken sailors in\n",
      "the distance, the jostling stevedores, the flaming passion in the\n",
      "Mexican’s face, the glint of the beast-eyes in the starlight, the sting\n",
      "of the steel in his neck, and the rush of blood, the crowd and the\n",
      "cries, the two bodies, his and the Mexican’s, locked together, rolling\n",
      "over and over and tearing up the sand, and from away off somewhere the\n",
      "mellow tinkling of a guitar. Such was the picture, and he thrilled to\n",
      "the memory of it, wondering if the man could paint it who had painted\n",
      "the pilot-schooner on the wall. The white beach, the stars, and the\n",
      "lights of the sugar steamers would look great, he thought, and midway\n",
      "on the sand the dark group of figures that surrounded the fighters. The\n",
      "knife occupied a place in the picture, he decided, and would show well,\n",
      "with a sort of gleam, in the light of the stars. But of all this no\n",
      "hint had crept into his speech. “He tried to bite off my nose,” he\n",
      "concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” the girl said, in a faint, far voice, and he noticed the shock in\n",
      "her sensitive face.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt a shock himself, and a blush of embarrassment shone faintly on\n",
      "his sunburned cheeks, though to him it burned as hotly as when his\n",
      "cheeks had been exposed to the open furnace-door in the fire-room. Such\n",
      "sordid things as stabbing affrays were evidently not fit subjects for\n",
      "conversation with a lady. People in the books, in her walk of life, did\n",
      "not talk about such things—perhaps they did not know about them,\n",
      "either.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a brief pause in the conversation they were trying to get\n",
      "started. Then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek. Even\n",
      "as she asked, he realized that she was making an effort to talk his\n",
      "talk, and he resolved to get away from it and talk hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was just an accident,” he said, putting his hand to his cheek. “One\n",
      "night, in a calm, with a heavy sea running, the main-boom-lift carried\n",
      "away, an’ next the tackle. The lift was wire, an’ it was threshin’\n",
      "around like a snake. The whole watch was tryin’ to grab it, an’ I\n",
      "rushed in an’ got swatted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” she said, this time with an accent of comprehension, though\n",
      "secretly his speech had been so much Greek to her and she was wondering\n",
      "what a _lift_ was and what _swatted_ meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This man Swineburne,” he began, attempting to put his plan into\n",
      "execution and pronouncing the _i_ long.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Swineburne,” he repeated, with the same mispronunciation. “The poet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Swinburne,” she corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that’s the chap,” he stammered, his cheeks hot again. “How long\n",
      "since he died?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, I haven’t heard that he was dead.” She looked at him curiously.\n",
      "“Where did you make his acquaintance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never clapped eyes on him,” was the reply. “But I read some of his\n",
      "poetry out of that book there on the table just before you come in. How\n",
      "do you like his poetry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "And thereat she began to talk quickly and easily upon the subject he\n",
      "had suggested. He felt better, and settled back slightly from the edge\n",
      "of the chair, holding tightly to its arms with his hands, as if it\n",
      "might get away from him and buck him to the floor. He had succeeded in\n",
      "making her talk her talk, and while she rattled on, he strove to follow\n",
      "her, marvelling at all the knowledge that was stowed away in that\n",
      "pretty head of hers, and drinking in the pale beauty of her face.\n",
      "Follow her he did, though bothered by unfamiliar words that fell glibly\n",
      "from her lips and by critical phrases and thought-processes that were\n",
      "foreign to his mind, but that nevertheless stimulated his mind and set\n",
      "it tingling. Here was intellectual life, he thought, and here was\n",
      "beauty, warm and wonderful as he had never dreamed it could be. He\n",
      "forgot himself and stared at her with hungry eyes. Here was something\n",
      "to live for, to win to, to fight for—ay, and die for. The books were\n",
      "true. There were such women in the world. She was one of them. She lent\n",
      "wings to his imagination, and great, luminous canvases spread\n",
      "themselves before him whereon loomed vague, gigantic figures of love\n",
      "and romance, and of heroic deeds for woman’s sake—for a pale woman, a\n",
      "flower of gold. And through the swaying, palpitant vision, as through a\n",
      "fairy mirage, he stared at the real woman, sitting there and talking of\n",
      "literature and art. He listened as well, but he stared, unconscious of\n",
      "the fixity of his gaze or of the fact that all that was essentially\n",
      "masculine in his nature was shining in his eyes. But she, who knew\n",
      "little of the world of men, being a woman, was keenly aware of his\n",
      "burning eyes. She had never had men look at her in such fashion, and it\n",
      "embarrassed her. She stumbled and halted in her utterance. The thread\n",
      "of argument slipped from her. He frightened her, and at the same time\n",
      "it was strangely pleasant to be so looked upon. Her training warned her\n",
      "of peril and of wrong, subtle, mysterious, luring; while her instincts\n",
      "rang clarion-voiced through her being, impelling her to hurdle caste\n",
      "and place and gain to this traveller from another world, to this\n",
      "uncouth young fellow with lacerated hands and a line of raw red caused\n",
      "by the unaccustomed linen at his throat, who, all too evidently, was\n",
      "soiled and tainted by ungracious existence. She was clean, and her\n",
      "cleanness revolted; but she was woman, and she was just beginning to\n",
      "learn the paradox of woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I was saying—what was I saying?” She broke off abruptly and laughed\n",
      "merrily at her predicament.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You was saying that this man Swinburne failed bein’ a great poet\n",
      "because—an’ that was as far as you got, miss,” he prompted, while to\n",
      "himself he seemed suddenly hungry, and delicious little thrills crawled\n",
      "up and down his spine at the sound of her laughter. Like silver, he\n",
      "thought to himself, like tinkling silver bells; and on the instant, and\n",
      "for an instant, he was transported to a far land, where under pink\n",
      "cherry blossoms, he smoked a cigarette and listened to the bells of the\n",
      "peaked pagoda calling straw-sandalled devotees to worship.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, thank you,” she said. “Swinburne fails, when all is said, because\n",
      "he is, well, indelicate. There are many of his poems that should never\n",
      "be read. Every line of the really great poets is filled with beautiful\n",
      "truth, and calls to all that is high and noble in the human. Not a line\n",
      "of the great poets can be spared without impoverishing the world by\n",
      "that much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it was great,” he said hesitatingly, “the little I read. I\n",
      "had no idea he was such a—a scoundrel. I guess that crops out in his\n",
      "other books.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are many lines that could be spared from the book you were\n",

      "felt, and to himself he likened himself to a sailor, in a strange ship,\n",
      "on a dark night, groping about in the unfamiliar running rigging. Well,\n",
      "he decided, it was up to him to get acquainted in this new world. He\n",

      "bull-like, bronzed by the sun, spilling over with rugged health and\n",
      "strength. And though he sat there, blushing and humble, again she felt\n",
      "drawn to him. She was surprised by a wanton thought that rushed into\n",
      "her mind. It seemed to her that if she could lay her two hands upon\n",
      "that neck that all its strength and vigor would flow out to her. She\n",
      "was shocked by this thought. It seemed to reveal to her an undreamed\n",
      "depravity in her nature. Besides, strength to her was a gross and\n",
      "brutish thing. Her ideal of masculine beauty had always been slender\n",
      "gracefulness. Yet the thought still persisted. It bewildered her that\n",
      "she should desire to place her hands on that sunburned neck. In truth,\n",
      "she was far from robust, and the need of her body and mind was for\n",
      "strength. But she did not know it. She knew only that no man had ever\n",

      "The process of getting into the dining room was a nightmare to him.\n",
      "Between halts and stumbles, jerks and lurches, locomotion had at times\n",
      "seemed impossible. But at last he had made it, and was seated alongside\n",
      "of Her. The array of knives and forks frightened him. They bristled\n",
      "with unknown perils, and he gazed at them, fascinated, till their\n",
      "dazzle became a background across which moved a succession of\n",
      "forecastle pictures, wherein he and his mates sat eating salt beef with\n",
      "sheath-knives and fingers, or scooping thick pea-soup out of pannikins\n",
      "by means of battered iron spoons. The stench of bad beef was in his\n",
      "nostrils, while in his ears, to the accompaniment of creaking timbers\n",
      "and groaning bulkheads, echoed the loud mouth-noises of the eaters. He\n",
      "watched them eating, and decided that they ate like pigs. Well, he\n",
      "would be careful here. He would make no noise. He would keep his mind\n",
      "upon it all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced around the table. Opposite him was Arthur, and Arthur’s\n",
      "brother, Norman. They were her brothers, he reminded himself, and his\n",
      "heart warmed toward them. How they loved each other, the members of\n",
      "this family! There flashed into his mind the picture of her mother, of\n",
      "the kiss of greeting, and of the pair of them walking toward him with\n",
      "arms entwined. Not in his world were such displays of affection between\n",
      "parents and children made. It was a revelation of the heights of\n",
      "existence that were attained in the world above. It was the finest\n",
      "thing yet that he had seen in this small glimpse of that world. He was\n",
      "moved deeply by appreciation of it, and his heart was melting with\n",
      "sympathetic tenderness. He had starved for love all his life. His\n",
      "nature craved love. It was an organic demand of his being. Yet he had\n",
      "gone without, and hardened himself in the process. He had not known\n",
      "that he needed love. Nor did he know it now. He merely saw it in\n",
      "operation, and thrilled to it, and thought it fine, and high, and\n",
      "splendid.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was glad that Mr. Morse was not there. It was difficult enough\n",
      "getting acquainted with her, and her mother, and her brother, Norman.\n",
      "Arthur he already knew somewhat. The father would have been too much\n",
      "for him, he felt sure. It seemed to him that he had never worked so\n",
      "hard in his life. The severest toil was child’s play compared with\n",
      "this. Tiny nodules of moisture stood out on his forehead, and his shirt\n",
      "was wet with sweat from the exertion of doing so many unaccustomed\n",
      "things at once. He had to eat as he had never eaten before, to handle\n",
      "strange tools, to glance surreptitiously about and learn how to\n",
      "accomplish each new thing, to receive the flood of impressions that was\n",
      "pouring in upon him and being mentally annotated and classified; to be\n",
      "conscious of a yearning for her that perturbed him in the form of a\n",
      "dull, aching restlessness; to feel the prod of desire to win to the\n",
      "walk in life whereon she trod, and to have his mind ever and again\n",
      "straying off in speculation and vague plans of how to reach to her.\n",
      "Also, when his secret glance went across to Norman opposite him, or to\n",
      "any one else, to ascertain just what knife or fork was to be used in\n",
      "any particular occasion, that person’s features were seized upon by his\n",
      "mind, which automatically strove to appraise them and to divine what\n",
      "they were—all in relation to her. Then he had to talk, to hear what was\n",
      "said to him and what was said back and forth, and to answer, when it\n",
      "was necessary, with a tongue prone to looseness of speech that required\n",
      "a constant curb. And to add confusion to confusion, there was the\n",
      "servant, an unceasing menace, that appeared noiselessly at his\n",
      "shoulder, a dire Sphinx that propounded puzzles and conundrums\n",
      "demanding instantaneous solution. He was oppressed throughout the meal\n",
      "by the thought of finger-bowls. Irrelevantly, insistently, scores of\n",
      "times, he wondered when they would come on and what they looked like.\n",
      "He had heard of such things, and now, sooner or later, somewhere in the\n",
      "next few minutes, he would see them, sit at table with exalted beings\n",
      "who used them—ay, and he would use them himself. And most important of\n",
      "all, far down and yet always at the surface of his thought, was the\n",
      "problem of how he should comport himself toward these persons. What\n",
      "should his attitude be? He wrestled continually and anxiously with the\n",
      "problem. There were cowardly suggestions that he should make believe,\n",
      "assume a part; and there were still more cowardly suggestions that\n",
      "warned him he would fail in such course, that his nature was not fitted\n",
      "to live up to it, and that he would make a fool of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was during the first part of the dinner, struggling to decide upon\n",
      "his attitude, that he was very quiet. He did not know that his\n",
      "quietness was giving the lie to Arthur’s words of the day before, when\n",
      "that brother of hers had announced that he was going to bring a wild\n",
      "man home to dinner and for them not to be alarmed, because they would\n",
      "find him an interesting wild man. Martin Eden could not have found it\n",
      "in him, just then, to believe that her brother could be guilty of such\n",
      "treachery—especially when he had been the means of getting this\n",
      "particular brother out of an unpleasant row. So he sat at table,\n",
      "perturbed by his own unfitness and at the same time charmed by all that\n",
      "went on about him. For the first time he realized that eating was\n",
      "something more than a utilitarian function. He was unaware of what he\n",
      "ate. It was merely food. He was feasting his love of beauty at this\n",
      "table where eating was an aesthetic function. It was an intellectual\n",
      "function, too. His mind was stirred. He heard words spoken that were\n",
      "meaningless to him, and other words that he had seen only in books and\n",
      "that no man or woman he had known was of large enough mental caliber to\n",
      "pronounce. When he heard such words dropping carelessly from the lips\n",
      "of the members of this marvellous family, her family, he thrilled with\n",
      "delight. The romance, and beauty, and high vigor of the books were\n",
      "coming true. He was in that rare and blissful state wherein a man sees\n",
      "his dreams stalk out from the crannies of fantasy and become fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never had he been at such an altitude of living, and he kept himself in\n",
      "the background, listening, observing, and pleasuring, replying in\n",
      "reticent monosyllables, saying, “Yes, miss,” and “No, miss,” to her,\n",
      "and “Yes, ma’am,” and “No, ma’am,” to her mother. He curbed the\n",
      "impulse, arising out of his sea-training, to say “Yes, sir,” and “No,\n",
      "sir,” to her brothers. He felt that it would be inappropriate and a\n",
      "confession of inferiority on his part—which would never do if he was to\n",
      "win to her. Also, it was a dictate of his pride. “By God!” he cried to\n",
      "himself, once; “I’m just as good as them, and if they do know lots that\n",
      "I don’t, I could learn ’m a few myself, all the same!” And the next\n",
      "moment, when she or her mother addressed him as “Mr. Eden,” his\n",
      "aggressive pride was forgotten, and he was glowing and warm with\n",
      "delight. He was a civilized man, that was what he was, shoulder to\n",
      "shoulder, at dinner, with people he had read about in books. He was in\n",
      "the books himself, adventuring through the printed pages of bound\n",
      "volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while he belied Arthur’s description, and appeared a gentle lamb\n",
      "rather than a wild man, he was racking his brains for a course of\n",
      "action. He was no gentle lamb, and the part of second fiddle would\n",
      "never do for the high-pitched dominance of his nature. He talked only\n",
      "when he had to, and then his speech was like his walk to the table,\n",
      "filled with jerks and halts as he groped in his polyglot vocabulary for\n",
      "words, debating over words he knew were fit but which he feared he\n",
      "could not pronounce, rejecting other words he knew would not be\n",
      "understood or would be raw and harsh. But all the time he was oppressed\n",
      "by the consciousness that this carefulness of diction was making a\n",
      "booby of him, preventing him from expressing what he had in him. Also,\n",
      "his love of freedom chafed against the restriction in much the same way\n",
      "his neck chafed against the starched fetter of a collar. Besides, he\n",
      "was confident that he could not keep it up. He was by nature powerful\n",
      "of thought and sensibility, and the creative spirit was restive and\n",
      "urgent. He was swiftly mastered by the concept or sensation in him that\n",
      "struggled in birth-throes to receive expression and form, and then he\n",
      "forgot himself and where he was, and the old words—the tools of speech\n",
      "he knew—slipped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, he declined something from the servant who interrupted and\n",
      "pestered at his shoulder, and he said, shortly and emphatically, “Pow!”\n",
      "\n",
      "On the instant those at the table were keyed up and expectant, the\n",
      "servant was smugly pleased, and he was wallowing in mortification. But\n",
      "he recovered himself quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the Kanaka for ‘finish,’” he explained, “and it just come out\n",
      "naturally. It’s spelt p-a-u.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He caught her curious and speculative eyes fixed on his hands, and,\n",
      "being in explanatory mood, he said:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“I just come down the Coast on one of the Pacific mail steamers. She\n",
      "was behind time, an’ around the Puget Sound ports we worked like\n",
      "niggers, storing cargo—mixed freight, if you know what that means.\n",
      "That’s how the skin got knocked off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, it wasn’t that,” she hastened to explain, in turn. “Your hands\n",
      "seemed too small for your body.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His cheeks were hot. He took it as an exposure of another of his\n",
      "deficiencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he said depreciatingly. “They ain’t big enough to stand the\n",
      "strain. I can hit like a mule with my arms and shoulders. They are too\n",
      "strong, an’ when I smash a man on the jaw the hands get smashed, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not happy at what he had said. He was filled with disgust at\n",
      "himself. He had loosed the guard upon his tongue and talked about\n",
      "things that were not nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was brave of you to help Arthur the way you did—and you a\n",
      "stranger,” she said tactfully, aware of his discomfiture though not of\n",
      "the reason for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He, in turn, realized what she had done, and in the consequent warm\n",
      "surge of gratefulness that overwhelmed him forgot his loose-worded\n",
      "tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wasn’t nothin’ at all,” he said. “Any guy ’ud do it for another.\n",
      "That bunch of hoodlums was lookin’ for trouble, an’ Arthur wasn’t\n",
      "botherin’ ’em none. They butted in on ’m, an’ then I butted in on them\n",
      "an’ poked a few. That’s where some of the skin off my hands went, along\n",
      "with some of the teeth of the gang. I wouldn’t ’a’ missed it for\n",
      "anything. When I seen—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, open-mouthed, on the verge of the pit of his own depravity\n",
      "and utter worthlessness to breathe the same air she did. And while\n",
      "Arthur took up the tale, for the twentieth time, of his adventure with\n",
      "the drunken hoodlums on the ferry-boat and of how Martin Eden had\n",
      "rushed in and rescued him, that individual, with frowning brows,\n",
      "meditated upon the fool he had made of himself, and wrestled more\n",
      "determinedly with the problem of how he should conduct himself toward\n",
      "these people. He certainly had not succeeded so far. He wasn’t of their\n",
      "tribe, and he couldn’t talk their lingo, was the way he put it to\n",
      "himself. He couldn’t fake being their kind. The masquerade would fail,\n",
      "and besides, masquerade was foreign to his nature. There was no room in\n",
      "him for sham or artifice. Whatever happened, he must be real. He\n",
      "couldn’t talk their talk just yet, though in time he would. Upon that\n",
      "he was resolved. But in the meantime, talk he must, and it must be his\n",
      "own talk, toned down, of course, so as to be comprehensible to them and\n",
      "so as not to shock them too much. And furthermore, he wouldn’t claim,\n",
      "not even by tacit acceptance, to be familiar with anything that was\n",
      "unfamiliar. In pursuance of this decision, when the two brothers,\n",
      "talking university shop, had used “trig” several times, Martin Eden\n",
      "demanded:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is _trig_?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trignometry,” Norman said; “a higher form of math.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what is math?” was the next question, which, somehow, brought the\n",
      "laugh on Norman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mathematics, arithmetic,” was the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin Eden nodded. He had caught a glimpse of the apparently\n",
      "illimitable vistas of knowledge. What he saw took on tangibility. His\n",
      "abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form. In\n",
      "the alchemy of his brain, trigonometry and mathematics and the whole\n",
      "field of knowledge which they betokened were transmuted into so much\n",
      "landscape. The vistas he saw were vistas of green foliage and forest\n",
      "glades, all softly luminous or shot through with flashing lights. In\n",
      "the distance, detail was veiled and blurred by a purple haze, but\n",
      "behind this purple haze, he knew, was the glamour of the unknown, the\n",
      "lure of romance. It was like wine to him. Here was adventure, something\n",
      "to do with head and hand, a world to conquer—and straightway from the\n",
      "back of his consciousness rushed the thought, _conquering, to win to\n",
      "her, that lily-pale spirit sitting beside him_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The glimmering vision was rent asunder and dissipated by Arthur, who,\n",

      "consciously and deliberately at first, but soon lost in the joy of\n",
      "creating in making life as he knew it appear before his listeners’\n",
      "eyes. He had been a member of the crew of the smuggling schooner\n",
      "_Halcyon_ when she was captured by a revenue cutter. He saw with wide\n",

      "from the vast mass of detail with an artist’s touch, drawing pictures\n",
      "of life that glowed and burned with light and color, injecting movement\n",
      "so that his listeners surged along with him on the flood of rough\n",

      "And while he talked, the girl looked at him with startled eyes. His\n",
      "fire warmed her. She wondered if she had been cold all her days. She\n",
      "wanted to lean toward this burning, blazing man that was like a volcano\n",
      "spouting forth strength, robustness, and health. She felt that she must\n",
      "lean toward him, and resisted by an effort. Then, too, there was the\n",
      "counter impulse to shrink away from him. She was repelled by those\n",
      "lacerated hands, grimed by toil so that the very dirt of life was\n",
      "ingrained in the flesh itself, by that red chafe of the collar and\n",
      "those bulging muscles. His roughness frightened her; each roughness of\n",
      "speech was an insult to her ear, each rough phase of his life an insult\n",
      "to her soul. And ever and again would come the draw of him, till she\n",
      "thought he must be evil to have such power over her. All that was most\n",
      "firmly established in her mind was rocking. His romance and adventure\n",
      "were battering at the conventions. Before his facile perils and ready\n",
      "laugh, life was no longer an affair of serious effort and restraint,\n",
      "but a toy, to be played with and turned topsy-turvy, carelessly to be\n",
      "lived and pleasured in, and carelessly to be flung aside. “Therefore,\n",
      "play!” was the cry that rang through her. “Lean toward him, if so you\n",
      "will, and place your two hands upon his neck!” She wanted to cry out at\n",
      "the recklessness of the thought, and in vain she appraised her own\n",
      "cleanness and culture and balanced all that she was against what he was\n",
      "not. She glanced about her and saw the others gazing at him with rapt\n",
      "attention; and she would have despaired had not she seen horror in her\n",
      "mother’s eyes—fascinated horror, it was true, but none the less horror.\n",
      "This man from outer darkness was evil. Her mother saw it, and her\n",
      "mother was right. She would trust her mother’s judgment in this as she\n",
      "had always trusted it in all things. The fire of him was no longer\n",
      "warm, and the fear of him was no longer poignant.\n",

      "Later, at the piano, she played for him, and at him, aggressively, with\n",
      "the vague intent of emphasizing the impassableness of the gulf that\n",
      "separated them. Her music was a club that she swung brutally upon his\n",
      "head; and though it stunned him and crushed him down, it incited him.\n",
      "He gazed upon her in awe. In his mind, as in her own, the gulf widened;\n",
      "but faster than it widened, towered his ambition to win across it. But\n",
      "he was too complicated a plexus of sensibilities to sit staring at a\n",
      "gulf a whole evening, especially when there was music. He was\n",
      "remarkably susceptible to music. It was like strong drink, firing him\n",
      "to audacities of feeling,—a drug that laid hold of his imagination and\n",
      "went cloud-soaring through the sky. It banished sordid fact, flooded\n",
      "his mind with beauty, loosed romance and to its heels added wings. He\n",
      "did not understand the music she played. It was different from the\n",
      "dance-hall piano-banging and blatant brass bands he had heard. But he\n",
      "had caught hints of such music from the books, and he accepted her\n",
      "playing largely on faith, patiently waiting, at first, for the lilting\n",
      "measures of pronounced and simple rhythm, puzzled because those\n",
      "measures were not long continued. Just as he caught the swing of them\n",
      "and started, his imagination attuned in flight, always they vanished\n",
      "away in a chaotic scramble of sounds that was meaningless to him, and\n",
      "that dropped his imagination, an inert weight, back to earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, it entered his mind that there was a deliberate rebuff in all\n",
      "this. He caught her spirit of antagonism and strove to divine the\n",
      "message that her hands pronounced upon the keys. Then he dismissed the\n",
      "thought as unworthy and impossible, and yielded himself more freely to\n",
      "the music. The old delightful condition began to be induced. His feet\n",
      "were no longer clay, and his flesh became spirit; before his eyes and\n",
      "behind his eyes shone a great glory; and then the scene before him\n",
      "vanished and he was away, rocking over the world that was to him a very\n",
      "dear world. The known and the unknown were commingled in the\n",
      "dream-pageant that thronged his vision. He entered strange ports of\n",
      "sun-washed lands, and trod market-places among barbaric peoples that no\n",
      "man had ever seen. The scent of the spice islands was in his nostrils\n",
      "as he had known it on warm, breathless nights at sea, or he beat up\n",
      "against the southeast trades through long tropic days, sinking\n",
      "palm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea behind and lifting\n",
      "palm-tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea ahead. Swift as thought\n",
      "the pictures came and went. One instant he was astride a broncho and\n",
      "flying through the fairy-colored Painted Desert country; the next\n",
      "instant he was gazing down through shimmering heat into the whited\n",
      "sepulchre of Death Valley, or pulling an oar on a freezing ocean where\n",
      "great ice islands towered and glistened in the sun. He lay on a coral\n",
      "beach where the cocoanuts grew down to the mellow-sounding surf. The\n",
      "hulk of an ancient wreck burned with blue fires, in the light of which\n",
      "danced the _hula_ dancers to the barbaric love-calls of the singers,\n",
      "who chanted to tinkling _ukuleles_ and rumbling tom-toms. It was a\n",
      "sensuous, tropic night. In the background a volcano crater was\n",
      "silhouetted against the stars. Overhead drifted a pale crescent moon,\n",
      "and the Southern Cross burned low in the sky.\n",

      "He was a harp; all life that he had known and that was his\n",
      "consciousness was the strings; and the flood of music was a wind that\n",
      "poured against those strings and set them vibrating with memories and\n",
      "dreams. He did not merely feel. Sensation invested itself in form and\n",
      "color and radiance, and what his imagination dared, it objectified in\n",
      "some sublimated and magic way. Past, present, and future mingled; and\n",
      "he went on oscillating across the broad, warm world, through high\n",
      "adventure and noble deeds to Her—ay, and with her, winning her, his arm\n",

      "gazed beyond the veil of sound and saw behind it the leap and pulse of\n",
      "life and the gigantic phantoms of the spirit. She was startled. The\n",
      "raw, stumbling lout was gone. The ill-fitting clothes, battered hands,\n",
      "and sunburned face remained; but these seemed the prison-bars through\n",
      "which she saw a great soul looking forth, inarticulate and dumb because\n",
      "of those feeble lips that would not give it speech. Only for a flashing\n",
      "moment did she see this, then she saw the lout returned, and she\n",
      "laughed at the whim of her fancy. But the impression of that fleeting\n",
      "glimpse lingered, and when the time came for him to beat a stumbling\n",
      "retreat and go, she lent him the volume of Swinburne, and another of\n",
      "Browning—she was studying Browning in one of her English courses. He\n",
      "seemed such a boy, as he stood blushing and stammering his thanks, that\n",
      "a wave of pity, maternal in its prompting, welled up in her. She did\n",
      "not remember the lout, nor the imprisoned soul, nor the man who had\n",
      "stared at her in all masculineness and delighted and frightened her.\n",
      "She saw before her only a boy, who was shaking her hand with a hand so\n",
      "calloused that it felt like a nutmeg-grater and rasped her skin, and\n",
      "who was saying jerkily:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“The greatest time of my life. You see, I ain’t used to things. . . ”\n",

      "As Martin Eden went down the steps, his hand dropped into his coat\n",
      "pocket. It came out with a brown rice paper and a pinch of Mexican\n",
      "tobacco, which were deftly rolled together into a cigarette. He drew\n",
      "the first whiff of smoke deep into his lungs and expelled it in a long\n",
      "and lingering exhalation. “By God!” he said aloud, in a voice of awe\n",
      "and wonder. “By God!” he repeated. And yet again he murmured, “By God!”\n",
      "Then his hand went to his collar, which he ripped out of the shirt and\n",
      "stuffed into his pocket. A cold drizzle was falling, but he bared his\n",
      "head to it and unbuttoned his vest, swinging along in splendid\n",
      "unconcern. He was only dimly aware that it was raining. He was in an\n",
      "ecstasy, dreaming dreams and reconstructing the scenes just past.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had met the woman at last—the woman that he had thought little\n",
      "about, not being given to thinking about women, but whom he had\n",
      "expected, in a remote way, he would sometime meet. He had sat next to\n",
      "her at table. He had felt her hand in his, he had looked into her eyes\n",
      "and caught a vision of a beautiful spirit;—but no more beautiful than\n",
      "the eyes through which it shone, nor than the flesh that gave it\n",
      "expression and form. He did not think of her flesh as flesh,—which was\n",
      "new to him; for of the women he had known that was the only way he\n",
      "thought. Her flesh was somehow different. He did not conceive of her\n",
      "body as a body, subject to the ills and frailties of bodies. Her body\n",
      "was more than the garb of her spirit. It was an emanation of her\n",
      "spirit, a pure and gracious crystallization of her divine essence. This\n",
      "feeling of the divine startled him. It shocked him from his dreams to\n",
      "sober thought. No word, no clew, no hint, of the divine had ever\n",
      "reached him before. He had never believed in the divine. He had always\n",
      "been irreligious, scoffing good-naturedly at the sky-pilots and their\n",
      "immortality of the soul. There was no life beyond, he had contended; it\n",
      "was here and now, then darkness everlasting. But what he had seen in\n",
      "her eyes was soul—immortal soul that could never die. No man he had\n",
      "known, nor any woman, had given him the message of immortality. But she\n",
      "had. She had whispered it to him the first moment she looked at him.\n",
      "Her face shimmered before his eyes as he walked along,—pale and\n",
      "serious, sweet and sensitive, smiling with pity and tenderness as only\n",
      "a spirit could smile, and pure as he had never dreamed purity could be.\n",
      "Her purity smote him like a blow. It startled him. He had known good\n",
      "and bad; but purity, as an attribute of existence, had never entered\n",
      "his mind. And now, in her, he conceived purity to be the superlative of\n",
      "goodness and of cleanness, the sum of which constituted eternal life.\n",
      "\n",
      "And promptly urged his ambition to grasp at eternal life. He was not\n",
      "fit to carry water for her—he knew that; it was a miracle of luck and a\n",
      "fantastic stroke that had enabled him to see her and be with her and\n",
      "talk with her that night. It was accidental. There was no merit in it.\n",
      "He did not deserve such fortune. His mood was essentially religious. He\n",
      "was humble and meek, filled with self-disparagement and abasement. In\n",
      "such frame of mind sinners come to the penitent form. He was convicted\n",
      "of sin. But as the meek and lowly at the penitent form catch splendid\n",
      "glimpses of their future lordly existence, so did he catch similar\n",
      "glimpses of the state he would gain to by possessing her. But this\n",
      "possession of her was dim and nebulous and totally different from\n",
      "possession as he had known it. Ambition soared on mad wings, and he saw\n",
      "himself climbing the heights with her, sharing thoughts with her,\n",
      "pleasuring in beautiful and noble things with her. It was a\n",
      "soul-possession he dreamed, refined beyond any grossness, a free\n",
      "comradeship of spirit that he could not put into definite thought. He\n",
      "did not think it. For that matter, he did not think at all. Sensation\n",
      "usurped reason, and he was quivering and palpitant with emotions he had\n",
      "never known, drifting deliciously on a sea of sensibility where feeling\n",
      "itself was exalted and spiritualized and carried beyond the summits of\n",
      "life.\n",

      "Martin Eden came back to earth. His was a fluid organism, swiftly\n",
      "adjustable, capable of flowing into and filling all sorts of nooks and\n",

      "self, grasping the situation clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a beaut, ain’t it?” he laughed back. “I didn’t know I was talkin’\n",

      "“You’ll be singing next,” was the policeman’s diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I won’t. Gimme a match an’ I’ll catch the next car home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He lighted his cigarette, said good night, and went on. “Now wouldn’t\n",
      "that rattle you?” he ejaculated under his breath. “That copper thought\n",
      "I was drunk.” He smiled to himself and meditated. “I guess I was,” he\n",
      "added; “but I didn’t think a woman’s face’d do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He caught a Telegraph Avenue car that was going to Berkeley. It was\n",
      "crowded with youths and young men who were singing songs and ever and\n",
      "again barking out college yells. He studied them curiously. They were\n",
      "university boys. They went to the same university that she did, were in\n",
      "her class socially, could know her, could see her every day if they\n",
      "wanted to. He wondered that they did not want to, that they had been\n",
      "out having a good time instead of being with her that evening, talking\n",
      "with her, sitting around her in a worshipful and adoring circle. His\n",
      "thoughts wandered on. He noticed one with narrow-slitted eyes and a\n",
      "loose-lipped mouth. That fellow was vicious, he decided. On shipboard\n",
      "he would be a sneak, a whiner, a tattler. He, Martin Eden, was a better\n",
      "man than that fellow. The thought cheered him. It seemed to draw him\n",
      "nearer to Her. He began comparing himself with the students. He grew\n",
      "conscious of the muscled mechanism of his body and felt confident that\n",
      "he was physically their master. But their heads were filled with\n",
      "knowledge that enabled them to talk her talk,—the thought depressed\n",
      "him. But what was a brain for? he demanded passionately. What they had\n",
      "done, he could do. They had been studying about life from the books\n",
      "while he had been busy living life. His brain was just as full of\n",
      "knowledge as theirs, though it was a different kind of knowledge. How\n",
      "many of them could tie a lanyard knot, or take a wheel or a lookout?\n",
      "His life spread out before him in a series of pictures of danger and\n",
      "daring, hardship and toil. He remembered his failures and scrapes in\n",
      "the process of learning. He was that much to the good, anyway. Later on\n",
      "they would have to begin living life and going through the mill as he\n",
      "had gone. Very well. While they were busy with that, he could be\n",
      "learning the other side of life from the books.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the car crossed the zone of scattered dwellings that separated\n",
      "Oakland from Berkeley, he kept a lookout for a familiar, two-story\n",
      "building along the front of which ran the proud sign, HIGGINBOTHAM’S\n",
      "CASH STORE. Martin Eden got off at this corner. He stared up for a\n",
      "moment at the sign. It carried a message to him beyond its mere\n",
      "wording. A personality of smallness and egotism and petty\n",
      "underhandedness seemed to emanate from the letters themselves. Bernard\n",
      "Higginbotham had married his sister, and he knew him well. He let\n",
      "himself in with a latch-key and climbed the stairs to the second floor.\n",
      "Here lived his brother-in-law. The grocery was below. There was a smell\n",
      "of stale vegetables in the air. As he groped his way across the hall he\n",
      "stumbled over a toy-cart, left there by one of his numerous nephews and\n",
      "nieces, and brought up against a door with a resounding bang. “The\n",
      "pincher,” was his thought; “too miserly to burn two cents’ worth of gas\n",
      "and save his boarders’ necks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He fumbled for the knob and entered a lighted room, where sat his\n",
      "sister and Bernard Higginbotham. She was patching a pair of his\n",
      "trousers, while his lean body was distributed over two chairs, his feet\n",
      "dangling in dilapidated carpet-slippers over the edge of the second\n",
      "chair. He glanced across the top of the paper he was reading, showing a\n",
      "pair of dark, insincere, sharp-staring eyes. Martin Eden never looked\n",
      "at him without experiencing a sense of repulsion. What his sister had\n",
      "seen in the man was beyond him. The other affected him as so much\n",
      "vermin, and always aroused in him an impulse to crush him under his\n",
      "foot. “Some day I’ll beat the face off of him,” was the way he often\n",
      "consoled himself for enduring the man’s existence. The eyes,\n",
      "weasel-like and cruel, were looking at him complainingly.\n",

      "“Well,” Martin demanded. “Out with it.”\n",
      "\n",

      "careful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin had intended to reply, but he was struck by the hopelessness of\n",
      "it. He gazed across the monstrous sordidness of soul to a chromo on the\n",
      "wall. It surprised him. He had always liked it, but it seemed that now\n",
      "he was seeing it for the first time. It was cheap, that was what it\n",
      "was, like everything else in this house. His mind went back to the\n",
      "house he had just left, and he saw, first, the paintings, and next,\n",
      "Her, looking at him with melting sweetness as she shook his hand at\n",
      "leaving. He forgot where he was and Bernard Higginbotham’s existence,\n",
      "till that gentleman demanded:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seen a ghost?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin came back and looked at the beady eyes, sneering, truculent,\n",
      "cowardly, and there leaped into his vision, as on a screen, the same\n",
      "eyes when their owner was making a sale in the store below—subservient\n",
      "eyes, smug, and oily, and flattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” Martin answered. “I seen a ghost. Good night. Good night,\n",

      "Martin Eden, with blood still crawling from contact with his\n",
      "brother-in-law, felt his way along the unlighted back hall and entered\n",
      "his room, a tiny cubbyhole with space for a bed, a wash-stand, and one\n",
      "chair. Mr. Higginbotham was too thrifty to keep a servant when his wife\n",
      "could do the work. Besides, the servant’s room enabled them to take in\n",
      "two boarders instead of one. Martin placed the Swinburne and Browning\n",
      "on the chair, took off his coat, and sat down on the bed. A screeching\n",
      "of asthmatic springs greeted the weight of his body, but he did not\n",
      "notice them. He started to take off his shoes, but fell to staring at\n",
      "the white plaster wall opposite him, broken by long streaks of dirty\n",
      "brown where rain had leaked through the roof. On this befouled\n",
      "background visions began to flow and burn. He forgot his shoes and\n",
      "stared long, till his lips began to move and he murmured, “Ruth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ruth.” He had not thought a simple sound could be so beautiful. It\n",
      "delighted his ear, and he grew intoxicated with the repetition of it.\n",
      "“Ruth.” It was a talisman, a magic word to conjure with. Each time he\n",
      "murmured it, her face shimmered before him, suffusing the foul wall\n",
      "with a golden radiance. This radiance did not stop at the wall. It\n",
      "extended on into infinity, and through its golden depths his soul went\n",
      "questing after hers. The best that was in him was out in splendid\n",
      "flood. The very thought of her ennobled and purified him, made him\n",
      "better, and made him want to be better. This was new to him. He had\n",
      "never known women who had made him better. They had always had the\n",
      "counter effect of making him beastly. He did not know that many of them\n",
      "had done their best, bad as it was. Never having been conscious of\n",
      "himself, he did not know that he had that in his being that drew love\n",
      "from women and which had been the cause of their reaching out for his\n",
      "youth. Though they had often bothered him, he had never bothered about\n",
      "them; and he would never have dreamed that there were women who had\n",
      "been better because of him. Always in sublime carelessness had he\n",
      "lived, till now, and now it seemed to him that they had always reached\n",
      "out and dragged at him with vile hands. This was not just to them, nor\n",
      "to himself. But he, who for the first time was becoming conscious of\n",
      "himself, was in no condition to judge, and he burned with shame as he\n",
      "stared at the vision of his infamy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up abruptly and tried to see himself in the dirty looking-glass\n",
      "over the wash-stand. He passed a towel over it and looked again, long\n",
      "and carefully. It was the first time he had ever really seen himself.\n",
      "His eyes were made for seeing, but up to that moment they had been\n",
      "filled with the ever changing panorama of the world, at which he had\n",
      "been too busy gazing, ever to gaze at himself. He saw the head and face\n",
      "of a young fellow of twenty, but, being unused to such appraisement, he\n",
      "did not know how to value it. Above a square-domed forehead he saw a\n",
      "mop of brown hair, nut-brown, with a wave to it and hints of curls that\n",
      "were a delight to any woman, making hands tingle to stroke it and\n",
      "fingers tingle to pass caresses through it. But he passed it by as\n",
      "without merit, in Her eyes, and dwelt long and thoughtfully on the\n",
      "high, square forehead,—striving to penetrate it and learn the quality\n",
      "of its content. What kind of a brain lay behind there? was his\n",
      "insistent interrogation. What was it capable of? How far would it take\n",
      "him? Would it take him to her?\n",
      "\n",
      "He wondered if there was soul in those steel-gray eyes that were often\n",
      "quite blue of color and that were strong with the briny airs of the\n",
      "sun-washed deep. He wondered, also, how his eyes looked to her. He\n",
      "tried to imagine himself she, gazing into those eyes of his, but failed\n",
      "in the jugglery. He could successfully put himself inside other men’s\n",
      "minds, but they had to be men whose ways of life he knew. He did not\n",
      "know her way of life. She was wonder and mystery, and how could he\n",
      "guess one thought of hers? Well, they were honest eyes, he concluded,\n",
      "and in them was neither smallness nor meanness. The brown sunburn of\n",
      "his face surprised him. He had not dreamed he was so black. He rolled\n",
      "up his shirt-sleeve and compared the white underside of the arm with\n",
      "his face. Yes, he was a white man, after all. But the arms were\n",
      "sunburned, too. He twisted his arm, rolled the biceps over with his\n",
      "other hand, and gazed underneath where he was least touched by the sun.\n",
      "It was very white. He laughed at his bronzed face in the glass at the\n",
      "thought that it was once as white as the underside of his arm; nor did\n",
      "he dream that in the world there were few pale spirits of women who\n",
      "could boast fairer or smoother skins than he—fairer than where he had\n",
      "escaped the ravages of the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "His might have been a cherub’s mouth, had not the full, sensuous lips a\n",
      "trick, under stress, of drawing firmly across the teeth. At times, so\n",
      "tightly did they draw, the mouth became stern and harsh, even ascetic.\n",
      "They were the lips of a fighter and of a lover. They could taste the\n",
      "sweetness of life with relish, and they could put the sweetness aside\n",
      "and command life. The chin and jaw, strong and just hinting of square\n",
      "aggressiveness, helped the lips to command life. Strength balanced\n",
      "sensuousness and had upon it a tonic effect, compelling him to love\n",
      "beauty that was healthy and making him vibrate to sensations that were\n",
      "wholesome. And between the lips were teeth that had never known nor\n",
      "needed the dentist’s care. They were white and strong and regular, he\n",
      "decided, as he looked at them. But as he looked, he began to be\n",
      "troubled. Somewhere, stored away in the recesses of his mind and\n",
      "vaguely remembered, was the impression that there were people who\n",
      "washed their teeth every day. They were the people from up above—people\n",
      "in her class. She must wash her teeth every day, too. What would she\n",
      "think if she learned that he had never washed his teeth in all the days\n",
      "of his life? He resolved to get a tooth-brush and form the habit. He\n",
      "would begin at once, to-morrow. It was not by mere achievement that he\n",
      "could hope to win to her. He must make a personal reform in all things,\n",
      "even to tooth-washing and neck-gear, though a starched collar affected\n",
      "him as a renunciation of freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "He held up his hand, rubbing the ball of the thumb over the calloused\n",
      "palm and gazing at the dirt that was ingrained in the flesh itself and\n",
      "which no brush could scrub away. How different was her palm! He\n",
      "thrilled deliciously at the remembrance. Like a rose-petal, he thought;\n",
      "cool and soft as a snowflake. He had never thought that a mere woman’s\n",
      "hand could be so sweetly soft. He caught himself imagining the wonder\n",
      "of a caress from such a hand, and flushed guiltily. It was too gross a\n",
      "thought for her. In ways it seemed to impugn her high spirituality. She\n",
      "was a pale, slender spirit, exalted far beyond the flesh; but\n",
      "nevertheless the softness of her palm persisted in his thoughts. He was\n",
      "used to the harsh callousness of factory girls and working women. Well\n",
      "he knew why their hands were rough; but this hand of hers . . . It was\n",
      "soft because she had never used it to work with. The gulf yawned\n",
      "between her and him at the awesome thought of a person who did not have\n",
      "to work for a living. He suddenly saw the aristocracy of the people who\n",
      "did not labor. It towered before him on the wall, a figure in brass,\n",
      "arrogant and powerful. He had worked himself; his first memories seemed\n",
      "connected with work, and all his family had worked. There was Gertrude.\n",
      "When her hands were not hard from the endless housework, they were\n",
      "swollen and red like boiled beef, what of the washing. And there was\n",
      "his sister Marian. She had worked in the cannery the preceding summer,\n",
      "and her slim, pretty hands were all scarred with the tomato-knives.\n",
      "Besides, the tips of two of her fingers had been left in the cutting\n",
      "machine at the paper-box factory the preceding winter. He remembered\n",
      "the hard palms of his mother as she lay in her coffin. And his father\n",
      "had worked to the last fading gasp; the horned growth on his hands must\n",
      "have been half an inch thick when he died. But Her hands were soft, and\n",
      "her mother’s hands, and her brothers’. This last came to him as a\n",
      "surprise; it was tremendously indicative of the highness of their\n",
      "caste, of the enormous distance that stretched between her and him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat back on the bed with a bitter laugh, and finished taking off his\n",
      "shoes. He was a fool; he had been made drunken by a woman’s face and by\n",
      "a woman’s soft, white hands. And then, suddenly, before his eyes, on\n",
      "the foul plaster-wall appeared a vision. He stood in front of a gloomy\n",
      "tenement house. It was night-time, in the East End of London, and\n",
      "before him stood Margey, a little factory girl of fifteen. He had seen\n",
      "her home after the bean-feast. She lived in that gloomy tenement, a\n",
      "place not fit for swine. His hand was going out to hers as he said good\n",
      "night. She had put her lips up to be kissed, but he wasn’t going to\n",
      "kiss her. Somehow he was afraid of her. And then her hand closed on his\n",
      "and pressed feverishly. He felt her callouses grind and grate on his,\n",
      "and a great wave of pity welled over him. He saw her yearning, hungry\n",
      "eyes, and her ill-fed female form which had been rushed from childhood\n",
      "into a frightened and ferocious maturity; then he put his arms about\n",
      "her in large tolerance and stooped and kissed her on the lips. Her glad\n",
      "little cry rang in his ears, and he felt her clinging to him like a\n",
      "cat. Poor little starveling! He continued to stare at the vision of\n",
      "what had happened in the long ago. His flesh was crawling as it had\n",
      "crawled that night when she clung to him, and his heart was warm with\n",
      "pity. It was a gray scene, greasy gray, and the rain drizzled greasily\n",
      "on the pavement stones. And then a radiant glory shone on the wall, and\n",
      "up through the other vision, displacing it, glimmered Her pale face\n",
      "under its crown of golden hair, remote and inaccessible as a star.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the Browning and the Swinburne from the chair and kissed them.\n",
      "Just the same, she told me to call again, he thought. He took another\n",

      "\n",

      "rough-house. I don’t care, though. I’m takin’ my lady friend just the\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, you did, too,” the other asserted warmly. “There was Maggie.”\n",

      "mean nothin’ by it, but it settled me for keeps. Wouldn’t look at me\n",

      "\n",

      "admiringly. “How d’ye do it, anyway, Mart?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By not carin’ about ’em,” was the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean makin’ b’lieve you don’t care about them?” Jim queried\n",
      "eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin considered for a moment, then answered, “Perhaps that will do,\n",
      "but with me I guess it’s different. I never have cared—much. If you can\n",
      "put it on, it’s all right, most likely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should ’a’ ben up at Riley’s barn last night,” Jim announced\n",
      "inconsequently. “A lot of the fellers put on the gloves. There was a\n",
      "peach from West Oakland. They called ’m ‘The Rat.’ Slick as silk. No\n",
      "one could touch ’m. We was all wishin’ you was there. Where was you\n",

      "\n",

      "“No, I think not,” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went downstairs and out into the street, breathing great breaths of\n",
      "air. He had been suffocating in that atmosphere, while the apprentice’s\n",
      "chatter had driven him frantic. There had been times when it was all he\n",
      "could do to refrain from reaching over and mopping Jim’s face in the\n",
      "mush-plate. The more he had chattered, the more remote had Ruth seemed\n",
      "to him. How could he, herding with such cattle, ever become worthy of\n",
      "her? He was appalled at the problem confronting him, weighted down by\n",
      "the incubus of his working-class station. Everything reached out to\n",
      "hold him down—his sister, his sister’s house and family, Jim the\n",
      "apprentice, everybody he knew, every tie of life. Existence did not\n",
      "taste good in his mouth. Up to then he had accepted existence, as he\n",
      "had lived it with all about him, as a good thing. He had never\n",
      "questioned it, except when he read books; but then, they were only\n",
      "books, fairy stories of a fairer and impossible world. But now he had\n",
      "seen that world, possible and real, with a flower of a woman called\n",
      "Ruth in the midmost centre of it; and thenceforth he must know bitter\n",
      "tastes, and longings sharp as pain, and hopelessness that tantalized\n",
      "because it fed on hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had debated between the Berkeley Free Library and the Oakland Free\n",
      "Library, and decided upon the latter because Ruth lived in Oakland. Who\n",
      "could tell?—a library was a most likely place for her, and he might see\n",
      "her there. He did not know the way of libraries, and he wandered\n",
      "through endless rows of fiction, till the delicate-featured\n",
      "French-looking girl who seemed in charge, told him that the reference\n",
      "department was upstairs. He did not know enough to ask the man at the\n",
      "desk, and began his adventures in the philosophy alcove. He had heard\n",
      "of book philosophy, but had not imagined there had been so much written\n",
      "about it. The high, bulging shelves of heavy tomes humbled him and at\n",
      "the same time stimulated him. Here was work for the vigor of his brain.\n",
      "He found books on trigonometry in the mathematics section, and ran the\n",
      "pages, and stared at the meaningless formulas and figures. He could\n",
      "read English, but he saw there an alien speech. Norman and Arthur knew\n",
      "that speech. He had heard them talking it. And they were her brothers.\n",
      "He left the alcove in despair. From every side the books seemed to\n",
      "press upon him and crush him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had never dreamed that the fund of human knowledge bulked so big. He\n",
      "was frightened. How could his brain ever master it all? Later, he\n",
      "remembered that there were other men, many men, who had mastered it;\n",
      "and he breathed a great oath, passionately, under his breath, swearing\n",
      "that his brain could do what theirs had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so he wandered on, alternating between depression and elation as he\n",
      "stared at the shelves packed with wisdom. In one miscellaneous section\n",
      "he came upon a “Norrie’s Epitome.” He turned the pages reverently. In a\n",
      "way, it spoke a kindred speech. Both he and it were of the sea. Then he\n",
      "found a “Bowditch” and books by Lecky and Marshall. There it was; he\n",
      "would teach himself navigation. He would quit drinking, work up, and\n",
      "become a captain. Ruth seemed very near to him in that moment. As a\n",
      "captain, he could marry her (if she would have him). And if she\n",
      "wouldn’t, well—he would live a good life among men, because of Her, and\n",
      "he would quit drinking anyway. Then he remembered the underwriters and\n",
      "the owners, the two masters a captain must serve, either of which could\n",
      "and would break him and whose interests were diametrically opposed. He\n",
      "cast his eyes about the room and closed the lids down on a vision of\n",
      "ten thousand books. No; no more of the sea for him. There was power in\n",
      "all that wealth of books, and if he would do great things, he must do\n",
      "them on the land. Besides, captains were not allowed to take their\n",
      "wives to sea with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noon came, and afternoon. He forgot to eat, and sought on for the books\n",
      "on etiquette; for, in addition to career, his mind was vexed by a\n",
      "simple and very concrete problem: _When you meet a young lady and she\n",
      "asks you to call, how soon can you call_? was the way he worded it to\n",
      "himself. But when he found the right shelf, he sought vainly for the\n",
      "answer. He was appalled at the vast edifice of etiquette, and lost\n",
      "himself in the mazes of visiting-card conduct between persons in polite\n",
      "society. He abandoned his search. He had not found what he wanted,\n",
      "though he had found that it would take all of a man’s time to be\n",
      "polite, and that he would have to live a preliminary life in which to\n",
      "learn how to be polite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you find what you wanted?” the man at the desk asked him as he was\n",
      "leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” he answered. “You have a fine library here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man nodded. “We should be glad to see you here often. Are you a\n",
      "sailor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” he answered. “And I’ll come again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how did he know that? he asked himself as he went down the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for the first block along the street he walked very stiff and\n",
      "straight and awkwardly, until he forgot himself in his thoughts,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A terrible restlessness that was akin to hunger afflicted Martin Eden.\n",
      "He was famished for a sight of the girl whose slender hands had gripped\n",
      "his life with a giant’s grasp. He could not steel himself to call upon\n",
      "her. He was afraid that he might call too soon, and so be guilty of an\n",
      "awful breach of that awful thing called etiquette. He spent long hours\n",
      "in the Oakland and Berkeley libraries, and made out application blanks\n",
      "for membership for himself, his sisters Gertrude and Marian, and Jim,\n",
      "the latter’s consent being obtained at the expense of several glasses\n",
      "of beer. With four cards permitting him to draw books, he burned the\n",
      "gas late in the servant’s room, and was charged fifty cents a week for\n",
      "it by Mr. Higginbotham.\n",
      "\n",
      "The many books he read but served to whet his unrest. Every page of\n",
      "every book was a peep-hole into the realm of knowledge. His hunger fed\n",
      "upon what he read, and increased. Also, he did not know where to begin,\n",
      "and continually suffered from lack of preparation. The commonest\n",
      "references, that he could see plainly every reader was expected to\n",
      "know, he did not know. And the same was true of the poetry he read\n",
      "which maddened him with delight. He read more of Swinburne than was\n",
      "contained in the volume Ruth had lent him; and “Dolores” he understood\n",
      "thoroughly. But surely Ruth did not understand it, he concluded. How\n",
      "could she, living the refined life she did? Then he chanced upon\n",
      "Kipling’s poems, and was swept away by the lilt and swing and glamour\n",
      "with which familiar things had been invested. He was amazed at the\n",
      "man’s sympathy with life and at his incisive psychology. _Psychology_\n",
      "was a new word in Martin’s vocabulary. He had bought a dictionary,\n",
      "which deed had decreased his supply of money and brought nearer the day\n",
      "on which he must sail in search of more. Also, it incensed Mr.\n",
      "Higginbotham, who would have preferred the money taking the form of\n",
      "board.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dared not go near Ruth’s neighborhood in the daytime, but night\n",
      "found him lurking like a thief around the Morse home, stealing glimpses\n",
      "at the windows and loving the very walls that sheltered her. Several\n",
      "times he barely escaped being caught by her brothers, and once he\n",
      "trailed Mr. Morse down town and studied his face in the lighted\n",
      "streets, longing all the while for some quick danger of death to\n",
      "threaten so that he might spring in and save her father. On another\n",
      "night, his vigil was rewarded by a glimpse of Ruth through a\n",
      "second-story window. He saw only her head and shoulders, and her arms\n",
      "raised as she fixed her hair before a mirror. It was only for a moment,\n",
      "but it was a long moment to him, during which his blood turned to wine\n",
      "and sang through his veins. Then she pulled down the shade. But it was\n",
      "her room—he had learned that; and thereafter he strayed there often,\n",
      "hiding under a dark tree on the opposite side of the street and smoking\n",
      "countless cigarettes. One afternoon he saw her mother coming out of a\n",
      "bank, and received another proof of the enormous distance that\n",
      "separated Ruth from him. She was of the class that dealt with banks. He\n",
      "had never been inside a bank in his life, and he had an idea that such\n",
      "institutions were frequented only by the very rich and the very\n",
      "powerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one way, he had undergone a moral revolution. Her cleanness and\n",
      "purity had reacted upon him, and he felt in his being a crying need to\n",
      "be clean. He must be that if he were ever to be worthy of breathing the\n",
      "same air with her. He washed his teeth, and scrubbed his hands with a\n",
      "kitchen scrub-brush till he saw a nail-brush in a drug-store window and\n",
      "divined its use. While purchasing it, the clerk glanced at his nails,\n",
      "suggested a nail-file, and so he became possessed of an additional\n",
      "toilet-tool. He ran across a book in the library on the care of the\n",
      "body, and promptly developed a penchant for a cold-water bath every\n",
      "morning, much to the amazement of Jim, and to the bewilderment of Mr.\n",
      "Higginbotham, who was not in sympathy with such high-fangled notions\n",
      "and who seriously debated whether or not he should charge Martin extra\n",
      "for the water. Another stride was in the direction of creased trousers.\n",
      "Now that Martin was aroused in such matters, he swiftly noted the\n",
      "difference between the baggy knees of the trousers worn by the working\n",
      "class and the straight line from knee to foot of those worn by the men\n",
      "above the working class. Also, he learned the reason why, and invaded\n",
      "his sister’s kitchen in search of irons and ironing-board. He had\n",
      "misadventures at first, hopelessly burning one pair and buying another,\n",
      "which expenditure again brought nearer the day on which he must put to\n",
      "sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the reform went deeper than mere outward appearance. He still\n",
      "smoked, but he drank no more. Up to that time, drinking had seemed to\n",
      "him the proper thing for men to do, and he had prided himself on his\n",
      "strong head which enabled him to drink most men under the table.\n",
      "Whenever he encountered a chance shipmate, and there were many in San\n",
      "Francisco, he treated them and was treated in turn, as of old, but he\n",
      "ordered for himself root beer or ginger ale and good-naturedly endured\n",
      "their chaffing. And as they waxed maudlin he studied them, watching the\n",
      "beast rise and master them and thanking God that he was no longer as\n",
      "they. They had their limitations to forget, and when they were drunk,\n",
      "their dim, stupid spirits were even as gods, and each ruled in his\n",
      "heaven of intoxicated desire. With Martin the need for strong drink had\n",
      "vanished. He was drunken in new and more profound ways—with Ruth, who\n",
      "had fired him with love and with a glimpse of higher and eternal life;\n",
      "with books, that had set a myriad maggots of desire gnawing in his\n",
      "brain; and with the sense of personal cleanliness he was achieving,\n",
      "that gave him even more superb health than what he had enjoyed and that\n",
      "made his whole body sing with physical well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night he went to the theatre, on the blind chance that he might see\n",
      "her there, and from the second balcony he did see her. He saw her come\n",
      "down the aisle, with Arthur and a strange young man with a football mop\n",
      "of hair and eyeglasses, the sight of whom spurred him to instant\n",
      "apprehension and jealousy. He saw her take her seat in the orchestra\n",
      "circle, and little else than her did he see that night—a pair of\n",
      "slender white shoulders and a mass of pale gold hair, dim with\n",
      "distance. But there were others who saw, and now and again, glancing at\n",
      "those about him, he noted two young girls who looked back from the row\n",
      "in front, a dozen seats along, and who smiled at him with bold eyes. He\n",
      "had always been easy-going. It was not in his nature to give rebuff. In\n",
      "the old days he would have smiled back, and gone further and encouraged\n",
      "smiling. But now it was different. He did smile back, then looked away,\n",
      "and looked no more deliberately. But several times, forgetting the\n",
      "existence of the two girls, his eyes caught their smiles. He could not\n",
      "re-thumb himself in a day, nor could he violate the intrinsic\n",
      "kindliness of his nature; so, at such moments, he smiled at the girls\n",
      "in warm human friendliness. It was nothing new to him. He knew they\n",
      "were reaching out their woman’s hands to him. But it was different now.\n",
      "Far down there in the orchestra circle was the one woman in all the\n",
      "world, so different, so terrifically different, from these two girls of\n",
      "his class, that he could feel for them only pity and sorrow. He had it\n",
      "in his heart to wish that they could possess, in some small measure,\n",
      "her goodness and glory. And not for the world could he hurt them\n",
      "because of their outreaching. He was not flattered by it; he even felt\n",
      "a slight shame at his lowliness that permitted it. He knew, did he\n",
      "belong in Ruth’s class, that there would be no overtures from these\n",
      "girls; and with each glance of theirs he felt the fingers of his own\n",
      "class clutching at him to hold him down.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left his seat before the curtain went down on the last act, intent\n",
      "on seeing Her as she passed out. There were always numbers of men who\n",
      "stood on the sidewalk outside, and he could pull his cap down over his\n",
      "eyes and screen himself behind some one’s shoulder so that she should\n",
      "not see him. He emerged from the theatre with the first of the crowd;\n",
      "but scarcely had he taken his position on the edge of the sidewalk when\n",
      "the two girls appeared. They were looking for him, he knew; and for the\n",
      "moment he could have cursed that in him which drew women. Their casual\n",
      "edging across the sidewalk to the curb, as they drew near, apprised him\n",
      "of discovery. They slowed down, and were in the thick of the crowd as\n",
      "they came up with him. One of them brushed against him and apparently\n",
      "for the first time noticed him. She was a slender, dark girl, with\n",
      "black, defiant eyes. But they smiled at him, and he smiled back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was automatic; he had said it so often before under similar\n",
      "circumstances of first meetings. Besides, he could do no less. There\n",
      "was that large tolerance and sympathy in his nature that would permit\n",
      "him to do no less. The black-eyed girl smiled gratification and\n",
      "greeting, and showed signs of stopping, while her companion, arm linked\n",
      "in arm, giggled and likewise showed signs of halting. He thought\n",
      "quickly. It would never do for Her to come out and see him talking\n",
      "there with them. Quite naturally, as a matter of course, he swung in\n",
      "along-side the dark-eyed one and walked with her. There was no\n",
      "awkwardness on his part, no numb tongue. He was at home here, and he\n",
      "held his own royally in the badinage, bristling with slang and\n",
      "sharpness, that was always the preliminary to getting acquainted in\n",
      "these swift-moving affairs. At the corner where the main stream of\n",
      "people flowed onward, he started to edge out into the cross street. But\n",
      "the girl with the black eyes caught his arm, following him and dragging\n",
      "her companion after her, as she cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on, Bill! What’s yer rush? You’re not goin’ to shake us so sudden\n",
      "as all that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He halted with a laugh, and turned, facing them. Across their shoulders\n",
      "he could see the moving throng passing under the street lamps. Where he\n",
      "stood it was not so light, and, unseen, he would be able to see Her as\n",
      "she passed by. She would certainly pass by, for that way led home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s her name?” he asked of the giggling girl, nodding at the\n",
      "dark-eyed one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ask her,” was the convulsed response.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, what is it?” he demanded, turning squarely on the girl in\n",
      "question.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ain’t told me yours, yet,” she retorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You never asked it,” he smiled. “Besides, you guessed the first\n",
      "rattle. It’s Bill, all right, all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, go ’long with you.” She looked him in the eyes, her own sharply\n",
      "passionate and inviting. “What is it, honest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again she looked. All the centuries of woman since sex began were\n",
      "eloquent in her eyes. And he measured her in a careless way, and knew,\n",
      "bold now, that she would begin to retreat, coyly and delicately, as he\n",
      "pursued, ever ready to reverse the game should he turn fainthearted.\n",

      "with the wisdom of the ages. He smiled bitterly at the incongruity of\n",
      "it, and was assailed by doubts. But between inner vision and outward\n",
      "pleasantry he found time to watch the theatre crowd streaming by. And\n",
      "then he saw Her, under the lights, between her brother and the strange\n",

      "their tragic efforts to be clean and trim, the cheap cloth, the cheap\n",

      "eyes of the girl before him, he saw Ruth’s clear, luminous eyes, like a\n",
      "saint’s, gazing at him out of unplumbed depths of purity. And, somehow,\n",
      "he felt within him a stir of power. He was better than this. Life meant\n",
      "more to him than it meant to these two girls whose thoughts did not go\n",
      "beyond ice-cream and a gentleman friend. He remembered that he had led\n",
      "always a secret life in his thoughts. These thoughts he had tried to\n",
      "share, but never had he found a woman capable of understanding—nor a\n",
      "man. He had tried, at times, but had only puzzled his listeners. And as\n",
      "his thoughts had been beyond them, so, he argued now, he must be beyond\n",
      "them. He felt power move in him, and clenched his fists. If life meant\n",
      "more to him, then it was for him to demand more from life, but he could\n",
      "not demand it from such companionship as this. Those bold black eyes\n",
      "had nothing to offer. He knew the thoughts behind them—of ice-cream and\n",
      "of something else. But those saint’s eyes alongside—they offered all he\n",
      "knew and more than he could guess. They offered books and painting,\n",
      "beauty and repose, and all the fine elegance of higher existence.\n",
      "Behind those black eyes he knew every thought process. It was like\n",
      "clockwork. He could watch every wheel go around. Their bid was low\n",
      "pleasure, narrow as the grave, that palled, and the grave was at the\n",
      "end of it. But the bid of the saint’s eyes was mystery, and wonder\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A week of heavy reading had passed since the evening he first met Ruth\n",
      "Morse, and still he dared not call. Time and again he nerved himself up\n",
      "to call, but under the doubts that assailed him his determination died\n",
      "away. He did not know the proper time to call, nor was there any one to\n",
      "tell him, and he was afraid of committing himself to an irretrievable\n",
      "blunder. Having shaken himself free from his old companions and old\n",
      "ways of life, and having no new companions, nothing remained for him\n",
      "but to read, and the long hours he devoted to it would have ruined a\n",
      "dozen pairs of ordinary eyes. But his eyes were strong, and they were\n",
      "backed by a body superbly strong. Furthermore, his mind was fallow. It\n",
      "had lain fallow all his life so far as the abstract thought of the\n",
      "books was concerned, and it was ripe for the sowing. It had never been\n",
      "jaded by study, and it bit hold of the knowledge in the books with\n",
      "sharp teeth that would not let go.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to him, by the end of the week, that he had lived centuries,\n",
      "so far behind were the old life and outlook. But he was baffled by lack\n",
      "of preparation. He attempted to read books that required years of\n",
      "preliminary specialization. One day he would read a book of antiquated\n",
      "philosophy, and the next day one that was ultra-modern, so that his\n",
      "head would be whirling with the conflict and contradiction of ideas. It\n",
      "was the same with the economists. On the one shelf at the library he\n",
      "found Karl Marx, Ricardo, Adam Smith, and Mill, and the abstruse\n",
      "formulas of the one gave no clew that the ideas of another were\n",
      "obsolete. He was bewildered, and yet he wanted to know. He had become\n",
      "interested, in a day, in economics, industry, and politics. Passing\n",
      "through the City Hall Park, he had noticed a group of men, in the\n",
      "centre of which were half a dozen, with flushed faces and raised\n",
      "voices, earnestly carrying on a discussion. He joined the listeners,\n",
      "and heard a new, alien tongue in the mouths of the philosophers of the\n",
      "people. One was a tramp, another was a labor agitator, a third was a\n",
      "law-school student, and the remainder was composed of wordy workingmen.\n",
      "For the first time he heard of socialism, anarchism, and single tax,\n",
      "and learned that there were warring social philosophies. He heard\n",
      "hundreds of technical words that were new to him, belonging to fields\n",
      "of thought that his meagre reading had never touched upon. Because of\n",
      "this he could not follow the arguments closely, and he could only guess\n",
      "at and surmise the ideas wrapped up in such strange expressions. Then\n",
      "there was a black-eyed restaurant waiter who was a theosophist, a union\n",
      "baker who was an agnostic, an old man who baffled all of them with the\n",
      "strange philosophy that _what is is right_, and another old man who\n",
      "discoursed interminably about the cosmos and the father-atom and the\n",
      "mother-atom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin Eden’s head was in a state of addlement when he went away after\n",
      "several hours, and he hurried to the library to look up the definitions\n",
      "of a dozen unusual words. And when he left the library, he carried\n",
      "under his arm four volumes: Madam Blavatsky’s “Secret Doctrine,”\n",
      "“Progress and Poverty,” “The Quintessence of Socialism,” and “Warfare\n",
      "of Religion and Science.” Unfortunately, he began on the “Secret\n",
      "Doctrine.” Every line bristled with many-syllabled words he did not\n",
      "understand. He sat up in bed, and the dictionary was in front of him\n",
      "more often than the book. He looked up so many new words that when they\n",
      "recurred, he had forgotten their meaning and had to look them up again.\n",
      "He devised the plan of writing the definitions in a note-book, and\n",
      "filled page after page with them. And still he could not understand. He\n",
      "read until three in the morning, and his brain was in a turmoil, but\n",
      "not one essential thought in the text had he grasped. He looked up, and\n",
      "it seemed that the room was lifting, heeling, and plunging like a ship\n",
      "upon the sea. Then he hurled the “Secret Doctrine” and many curses\n",
      "across the room, turned off the gas, and composed himself to sleep. Nor\n",
      "did he have much better luck with the other three books. It was not\n",
      "that his brain was weak or incapable; it could think these thoughts\n",
      "were it not for lack of training in thinking and lack of the\n",
      "thought-tools with which to think. He guessed this, and for a while\n",
      "entertained the idea of reading nothing but the dictionary until he had\n",
      "mastered every word in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poetry, however, was his solace, and he read much of it, finding his\n",
      "greatest joy in the simpler poets, who were more understandable. He\n",
      "loved beauty, and there he found beauty. Poetry, like music, stirred\n",
      "him profoundly, and, though he did not know it, he was preparing his\n",
      "mind for the heavier work that was to come. The pages of his mind were\n",
      "blank, and, without effort, much he read and liked, stanza by stanza,\n",
      "was impressed upon those pages, so that he was soon able to extract\n",
      "great joy from chanting aloud or under his breath the music and the\n",
      "beauty of the printed words he had read. Then he stumbled upon Gayley’s\n",
      "“Classic Myths” and Bulfinch’s “Age of Fable,” side by side on a\n",
      "library shelf. It was illumination, a great light in the darkness of\n",
      "his ignorance, and he read poetry more avidly than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man at the desk in the library had seen Martin there so often that\n",
      "he had become quite cordial, always greeting him with a smile and a nod\n",
      "when he entered. It was because of this that Martin did a daring thing.\n",
      "Drawing out some books at the desk, and while the man was stamping the\n",
      "cards, Martin blurted out:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, there’s something I’d like to ask you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man smiled and paid attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you meet a young lady an’ she asks you to call, how soon can you\n",
      "call?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin felt his shirt press and cling to his shoulders, what of the\n",
      "sweat of the effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why I’d say any time,” the man answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but this is different,” Martin objected. “She—I—well, you see,\n",
      "it’s this way: maybe she won’t be there. She goes to the university.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then call again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I said ain’t what I meant,” Martin confessed falteringly, while\n",
      "he made up his mind to throw himself wholly upon the other’s mercy.\n",
      "“I’m just a rough sort of a fellow, an’ I ain’t never seen anything of\n",
      "society. This girl is all that I ain’t, an’ I ain’t anything that she\n",
      "is. You don’t think I’m playin’ the fool, do you?” he demanded\n",
      "abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no; not at all, I assure you,” the other protested. “Your request\n",
      "is not exactly in the scope of the reference department, but I shall be\n",
      "only too pleased to assist you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin looked at him admiringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I could tear it off that way, I’d be all right,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg pardon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean if I could talk easy that way, an’ polite, an’ all the rest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” said the other, with comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the best time to call? The afternoon?—not too close to\n",
      "meal-time? Or the evening? Or Sunday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you,” the librarian said with a brightening face. “You call\n",
      "her up on the telephone and find out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll do it,” he said, picking up his books and starting away.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned back and asked:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you’re speakin’ to a young lady—say, for instance, Miss Lizzie\n",
      "Smith—do you say ‘Miss Lizzie’? or ‘Miss Smith’?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say ‘Miss Smith,’” the librarian stated authoritatively. “Say ‘Miss\n",
      "Smith’ always—until you come to know her better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So it was that Martin Eden solved the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come down any time; I’ll be at home all afternoon,” was Ruth’s reply\n",
      "over the telephone to his stammered request as to when he could return\n",
      "the borrowed books.\n",
      "\n",
      "She met him at the door herself, and her woman’s eyes took in\n",
      "immediately the creased trousers and the certain slight but indefinable\n",
      "change in him for the better. Also, she was struck by his face. It was\n",
      "almost violent, this health of his, and it seemed to rush out of him\n",
      "and at her in waves of force. She felt the urge again of the desire to\n",
      "lean toward him for warmth, and marvelled again at the effect his\n",
      "presence produced upon her. And he, in turn, knew again the swimming\n",
      "sensation of bliss when he felt the contact of her hand in greeting.\n",
      "The difference between them lay in that she was cool and self-possessed\n",
      "while his face flushed to the roots of the hair. He stumbled with his\n",
      "old awkwardness after her, and his shoulders swung and lurched\n",
      "perilously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once they were seated in the living-room, he began to get on\n",
      "easily—more easily by far than he had expected. She made it easy for\n",
      "him; and the gracious spirit with which she did it made him love her\n",
      "more madly than ever. They talked first of the borrowed books, of the\n",
      "Swinburne he was devoted to, and of the Browning he did not understand;\n",
      "and she led the conversation on from subject to subject, while she\n",
      "pondered the problem of how she could be of help to him. She had\n",
      "thought of this often since their first meeting. She wanted to help\n",
      "him. He made a call upon her pity and tenderness that no one had ever\n",
      "made before, and the pity was not so much derogatory of him as maternal\n",
      "in her. Her pity could not be of the common sort, when the man who drew\n",
      "it was so much man as to shock her with maidenly fears and set her mind\n",
      "and pulse thrilling with strange thoughts and feelings. The old\n",
      "fascination of his neck was there, and there was sweetness in the\n",
      "thought of laying her hands upon it. It seemed still a wanton impulse,\n",
      "but she had grown more used to it. She did not dream that in such guise\n",
      "new-born love would epitomize itself. Nor did she dream that the\n",
      "feeling he excited in her was love. She thought she was merely\n",
      "interested in him as an unusual type possessing various potential\n",
      "excellencies, and she even felt philanthropic about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not know she desired him; but with him it was different. He\n",
      "knew that he loved her, and he desired her as he had never before\n",
      "desired anything in his life. He had loved poetry for beauty’s sake;\n",
      "but since he met her the gates to the vast field of love-poetry had\n",
      "been opened wide. She had given him understanding even more than\n",
      "Bulfinch and Gayley. There was a line that a week before he would not\n",
      "have favored with a second thought—“God’s own mad lover dying on a\n",
      "kiss”; but now it was ever insistent in his mind. He marvelled at the\n",
      "wonder of it and the truth; and as he gazed upon her he knew that he\n",
      "could die gladly upon a kiss. He felt himself God’s own mad lover, and\n",
      "no accolade of knighthood could have given him greater pride. And at\n",
      "last he knew the meaning of life and why he had been born.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he gazed at her and listened, his thoughts grew daring. He reviewed\n",
      "all the wild delight of the pressure of her hand in his at the door,\n",
      "and longed for it again. His gaze wandered often toward her lips, and\n",
      "he yearned for them hungrily. But there was nothing gross or earthly\n",
      "about this yearning. It gave him exquisite delight to watch every\n",
      "movement and play of those lips as they enunciated the words she spoke;\n",
      "yet they were not ordinary lips such as all men and women had. Their\n",
      "substance was not mere human clay. They were lips of pure spirit, and\n",
      "his desire for them seemed absolutely different from the desire that\n",
      "had led him to other women’s lips. He could kiss her lips, rest his own\n",
      "physical lips upon them, but it would be with the lofty and awful\n",
      "fervor with which one would kiss the robe of God. He was not conscious\n",
      "of this transvaluation of values that had taken place in him, and was\n",
      "unaware that the light that shone in his eyes when he looked at her was\n",
      "quite the same light that shines in all men’s eyes when the desire of\n",
      "love is upon them. He did not dream how ardent and masculine his gaze\n",
      "was, nor that the warm flame of it was affecting the alchemy of her\n",
      "spirit. Her penetrative virginity exalted and disguised his own\n",
      "emotions, elevating his thoughts to a star-cool chastity, and he would\n",
      "have been startled to learn that there was that shining out of his\n",
      "eyes, like warm waves, that flowed through her and kindled a kindred\n",
      "warmth. She was subtly perturbed by it, and more than once, though she\n",
      "knew not why, it disrupted her train of thought with its delicious\n",
      "intrusion and compelled her to grope for the remainder of ideas partly\n",
      "uttered. Speech was always easy with her, and these interruptions would\n",
      "have puzzled her had she not decided that it was because he was a\n",
      "remarkable type. She was very sensitive to impressions, and it was not\n",
      "strange, after all, that this aura of a traveller from another world\n",
      "should so affect her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem in the background of her consciousness was how to help him,\n",
      "and she turned the conversation in that direction; but it was Martin\n",
      "who came to the point first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder if I can get some advice from you,” he began, and received an\n",
      "acquiescence of willingness that made his heart bound. “You remember\n",
      "the other time I was here I said I couldn’t talk about books an’ things\n",
      "because I didn’t know how? Well, I’ve ben doin’ a lot of thinkin’ ever\n",
      "since. I’ve ben to the library a whole lot, but most of the books I’ve\n",
      "tackled have ben over my head. Mebbe I’d better begin at the beginnin’.\n",
      "I ain’t never had no advantages. I’ve worked pretty hard ever since I\n",
      "was a kid, an’ since I’ve ben to the library, lookin’ with new eyes at\n",
      "books—an’ lookin’ at new books, too—I’ve just about concluded that I\n",
      "ain’t ben reading the right kind. You know the books you find in\n",
      "cattle-camps an’ fo’c’s’ls ain’t the same you’ve got in this house, for\n",

      "sign that he was about to go.\n",
      "\n",

      "When she returned with the grammar, she drew a chair near his—he\n",

      "inclined toward each other. He could hardly follow her outlining of the\n",
      "work he must do, so amazed was he by her delightful propinquity. But\n",
      "when she began to lay down the importance of conjugation, he forgot all\n",

      "glimpse he was catching into the tie-ribs of language. He leaned closer\n",
      "to the page, and her hair touched his cheek. He had fainted but once in\n",
      "his life, and he thought he was going to faint again. He could scarcely\n",
      "breathe, and his heart was pounding the blood up into his throat and\n",
      "suffocating him. Never had she seemed so accessible as now. For the\n",
      "moment the great gulf that separated them was bridged. But there was no\n",
      "diminution in the loftiness of his feeling for her. She had not\n",
      "descended to him. It was he who had been caught up into the clouds and\n",
      "carried to her. His reverence for her, in that moment, was of the same\n",
      "order as religious awe and fervor. It seemed to him that he had\n",
      "intruded upon the holy of holies, and slowly and carefully he moved his\n",
      "head aside from the contact which thrilled him like an electric shock\n",
      "and of which she had not been aware.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Several weeks went by, during which Martin Eden studied his grammar,\n",
      "reviewed the books on etiquette, and read voraciously the books that\n",
      "caught his fancy. Of his own class he saw nothing. The girls of the\n",
      "Lotus Club wondered what had become of him and worried Jim with\n",
      "questions, and some of the fellows who put on the glove at Riley’s were\n",
      "glad that Martin came no more. He made another discovery of\n",
      "treasure-trove in the library. As the grammar had shown him the\n",
      "tie-ribs of language, so that book showed him the tie-ribs of poetry,\n",
      "and he began to learn metre and construction and form, beneath the\n",
      "beauty he loved finding the why and wherefore of that beauty. Another\n",
      "modern book he found treated poetry as a representative art, treated it\n",
      "exhaustively, with copious illustrations from the best in literature.\n",
      "Never had he read fiction with so keen zest as he studied these books.\n",
      "And his fresh mind, untaxed for twenty years and impelled by maturity\n",
      "of desire, gripped hold of what he read with a virility unusual to the\n",
      "student mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he looked back now from his vantage-ground, the old world he had\n",
      "known, the world of land and sea and ships, of sailor-men and\n",
      "harpy-women, seemed a very small world; and yet it blended in with this\n",
      "new world and expanded. His mind made for unity, and he was surprised\n",
      "when at first he began to see points of contact between the two worlds.\n",
      "And he was ennobled, as well, by the loftiness of thought and beauty he\n",
      "found in the books. This led him to believe more firmly than ever that\n",
      "up above him, in society like Ruth and her family, all men and women\n",
      "thought these thoughts and lived them. Down below where he lived was\n",
      "the ignoble, and he wanted to purge himself of the ignoble that had\n",
      "soiled all his days, and to rise to that sublimated realm where dwelt\n",
      "the upper classes. All his childhood and youth had been troubled by a\n",
      "vague unrest; he had never known what he wanted, but he had wanted\n",
      "something that he had hunted vainly for until he met Ruth. And now his\n",
      "unrest had become sharp and painful, and he knew at last, clearly and\n",
      "definitely, that it was beauty, and intellect, and love that he must\n",
      "have.\n",
      "\n",
      "During those several weeks he saw Ruth half a dozen times, and each\n",
      "time was an added inspiration. She helped him with his English,\n",
      "corrected his pronunciation, and started him on arithmetic. But their\n",
      "intercourse was not all devoted to elementary study. He had seen too\n",
      "much of life, and his mind was too matured, to be wholly content with\n",
      "fractions, cube root, parsing, and analysis; and there were times when\n",
      "their conversation turned on other themes—the last poetry he had read,\n",
      "the latest poet she had studied. And when she read aloud to him her\n",
      "favorite passages, he ascended to the topmost heaven of delight. Never,\n",
      "in all the women he had heard speak, had he heard a voice like hers.\n",
      "The least sound of it was a stimulus to his love, and he thrilled and\n",
      "throbbed with every word she uttered. It was the quality of it, the\n",
      "repose, and the musical modulation—the soft, rich, indefinable product\n",
      "of culture and a gentle soul. As he listened to her, there rang in the\n",
      "ears of his memory the harsh cries of barbarian women and of hags, and,\n",
      "in lesser degrees of harshness, the strident voices of working women\n",
      "and of the girls of his own class. Then the chemistry of vision would\n",
      "begin to work, and they would troop in review across his mind, each, by\n",
      "contrast, multiplying Ruth’s glories. Then, too, his bliss was\n",
      "heightened by the knowledge that her mind was comprehending what she\n",
      "read and was quivering with appreciation of the beauty of the written\n",
      "thought. She read to him much from “The Princess,” and often he saw her\n",
      "eyes swimming with tears, so finely was her aesthetic nature strung. At\n",
      "such moments her own emotions elevated him till he was as a god, and,\n",
      "as he gazed at her and listened, he seemed gazing on the face of life\n",
      "and reading its deepest secrets. And then, becoming aware of the\n",
      "heights of exquisite sensibility he attained, he decided that this was\n",
      "love and that love was the greatest thing in the world. And in review\n",
      "would pass along the corridors of memory all previous thrills and\n",
      "burnings he had known,—the drunkenness of wine, the caresses of women,\n",
      "the rough play and give and take of physical contests,—and they seemed\n",
      "trivial and mean compared with this sublime ardor he now enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation was obscured to Ruth. She had never had any experiences\n",
      "of the heart. Her only experiences in such matters were of the books,\n",
      "where the facts of ordinary day were translated by fancy into a fairy\n",
      "realm of unreality; and she little knew that this rough sailor was\n",
      "creeping into her heart and storing there pent forces that would some\n",
      "day burst forth and surge through her in waves of fire. She did not\n",
      "know the actual fire of love. Her knowledge of love was purely\n",
      "theoretical, and she conceived of it as lambent flame, gentle as the\n",
      "fall of dew or the ripple of quiet water, and cool as the velvet-dark\n",
      "of summer nights. Her idea of love was more that of placid affection,\n",
      "serving the loved one softly in an atmosphere, flower-scented and\n",
      "dim-lighted, of ethereal calm. She did not dream of the volcanic\n",
      "convulsions of love, its scorching heat and sterile wastes of parched\n",
      "ashes. She knew neither her own potencies, nor the potencies of the\n",
      "world; and the deeps of life were to her seas of illusion. The conjugal\n",
      "affection of her father and mother constituted her ideal of\n",
      "love-affinity, and she looked forward some day to emerging, without\n",
      "shock or friction, into that same quiet sweetness of existence with a\n",
      "loved one.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it was that she looked upon Martin Eden as a novelty, a strange\n",
      "individual, and she identified with novelty and strangeness the effects\n",
      "he produced upon her. It was only natural. In similar ways she had\n",
      "experienced unusual feelings when she looked at wild animals in the\n",
      "menagerie, or when she witnessed a storm of wind, or shuddered at the\n",
      "bright-ribbed lightning. There was something cosmic in such things, and\n",
      "there was something cosmic in him. He came to her breathing of large\n",
      "airs and great spaces. The blaze of tropic suns was in his face, and in\n",
      "his swelling, resilient muscles was the primordial vigor of life. He\n",
      "was marred and scarred by that mysterious world of rough men and\n",
      "rougher deeds, the outposts of which began beyond her horizon. He was\n",
      "untamed, wild, and in secret ways her vanity was touched by the fact\n",
      "that he came so mildly to her hand. Likewise she was stirred by the\n",
      "common impulse to tame the wild thing. It was an unconscious impulse,\n",
      "and farthest from her thoughts that her desire was to re-thumb the clay\n",
      "of him into a likeness of her father’s image, which image she believed\n",
      "to be the finest in the world. Nor was there any way, out of her\n",
      "inexperience, for her to know that the cosmic feel she caught of him\n",
      "was that most cosmic of things, love, which with equal power drew men\n",
      "and women together across the world, compelled stags to kill each other\n",
      "in the rutting season, and drove even the elements irresistibly to\n",
      "unite.\n",
      "\n",
      "His swift development was a source of surprise and interest. She\n",
      "detected unguessed finenesses in him that seemed to bud, day by day,\n",
      "like flowers in congenial soil. She read Browning aloud to him, and was\n",
      "often puzzled by the strange interpretations he gave to mooted\n",
      "passages. It was beyond her to realize that, out of his experience of\n",
      "men and women and life, his interpretations were far more frequently\n",
      "correct than hers. His conceptions seemed naive to her, though she was\n",
      "often fired by his daring flights of comprehension, whose orbit-path\n",
      "was so wide among the stars that she could not follow and could only\n",
      "sit and thrill to the impact of unguessed power. Then she played to\n",
      "him—no longer at him—and probed him with music that sank to depths\n",
      "beyond her plumb-line. His nature opened to music as a flower to the\n",
      "sun, and the transition was quick from his working-class rag-time and\n",
      "jingles to her classical display pieces that she knew nearly by heart.\n",
      "Yet he betrayed a democratic fondness for Wagner, and the “Tannhäuser”\n",
      "overture, when she had given him the clew to it, claimed him as nothing\n",
      "else she played. In an immediate way it personified his life. All his\n",
      "past was the _Venusburg_ motif, while her he identified somehow with\n",
      "the _Pilgrim’s Chorus_ motif; and from the exalted state this elevated\n",
      "him to, he swept onward and upward into that vast shadow-realm of\n",
      "spirit-groping, where good and evil war eternally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes he questioned, and induced in her mind temporary doubts as to\n",
      "the correctness of her own definitions and conceptions of music. But\n",
      "her singing he did not question. It was too wholly her, and he sat\n",
      "always amazed at the divine melody of her pure soprano voice. And he\n",
      "could not help but contrast it with the weak pipings and shrill\n",
      "quaverings of factory girls, ill-nourished and untrained, and with the\n",
      "raucous shriekings from gin-cracked throats of the women of the seaport\n",

      "it, and her intentions were good. Besides, it was pleasant to be with\n",
      "him. He did not repel her. That first repulsion had been really a fear\n",
      "of her undiscovered self, and the fear had gone to sleep. Though she\n",
      "did not know it, she had a feeling in him of proprietary right. Also,\n",
      "he had a tonic effect upon her. She was studying hard at the\n",
      "university, and it seemed to strengthen her to emerge from the dusty\n",
      "books and have the fresh sea-breeze of his personality blow upon her.\n",
      "Strength! Strength was what she needed, and he gave it to her in\n",
      "generous measure. To come into the same room with him, or to meet him\n",

      "Arizona, so that when he was dead, Mr. Butler, Charles Butler he was\n",
      "called, found himself alone in the world. His father had come from\n",
      "Australia, you know, and so he had no relatives in California. He went\n",
      "to work in a printing-office,—I have heard him tell of it many\n",
      "times,—and he got three dollars a week, at first. His income to-day is\n",
      "at least thirty thousand a year. How did he do it? He was honest, and\n",
      "faithful, and industrious, and economical. He denied himself the\n",
      "enjoyments that most boys indulge in. He made it a point to save so\n",
      "much every week, no matter what he had to do without in order to save\n",
      "it. Of course, he was soon earning more than three dollars a week, and\n",
      "as his wages increased he saved more and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He worked in the daytime, and at night he went to night school. He had\n",
      "his eyes fixed always on the future. Later on he went to night high\n",
      "school. When he was only seventeen, he was earning excellent wages at\n",
      "setting type, but he was ambitious. He wanted a career, not a\n",
      "livelihood, and he was content to make immediate sacrifices for his\n",
      "ultimate gain. He decided upon the law, and he entered father’s office\n",
      "as an office boy—think of that!—and got only four dollars a week. But\n",
      "he had learned how to be economical, and out of that four dollars he\n",

      "She paused for breath, and to note how Martin was receiving it. His\n",

      "\n",
      "“There’s one thing I’ll bet you,” he said, “and it is that Mr. Butler\n",

      "She nodded her head in agreement, and hastened to explain:-\n",

      "“Do you know,” he added, “I feel sorry for Mr. Butler. He was too young\n",
      "to know better, but he robbed himself of life for the sake of thirty\n",
      "thousand a year that’s clean wasted upon him. Why, thirty thousand,\n",

      "It was just such uniqueness of points of view that startled Ruth. Not\n",
      "only were they new to her, and contrary to her own beliefs, but she\n",
      "always felt in them germs of truth that threatened to unseat or modify\n",
      "her own convictions. Had she been fourteen instead of twenty-four, she\n",
      "might have been changed by them; but she was twenty-four, conservative\n",
      "by nature and upbringing, and already crystallized into the cranny of\n",
      "life where she had been born and formed. It was true, his bizarre\n",
      "judgments troubled her in the moments they were uttered, but she\n",
      "ascribed them to his novelty of type and strangeness of living, and\n",
      "they were soon forgotten. Nevertheless, while she disapproved of them,\n",
      "the strength of their utterance, and the flashing of eyes and\n",
      "earnestness of face that accompanied them, always thrilled her and drew\n",
      "her toward him. She would never have guessed that this man who had come\n",
      "from beyond her horizon, was, in such moments, flashing on beyond her\n",
      "horizon with wider and deeper concepts. Her own limits were the limits\n",
      "of her horizon; but limited minds can recognize limitations only in\n",
      "others. And so she felt that her outlook was very wide indeed, and that\n",

      "“But I have not finished my story,” she said. “He worked, so father\n",
      "says, as no other office boy he ever had. Mr. Butler was always eager\n",
      "to work. He never was late, and he was usually at the office a few\n",
      "minutes before his regular time. And yet he saved his time. Every spare\n",
      "moment was devoted to study. He studied book-keeping and type-writing,\n",
      "and he paid for lessons in shorthand by dictating at night to a court\n",
      "reporter who needed practice. He quickly became a clerk, and he made\n",
      "himself invaluable. Father appreciated him and saw that he was bound to\n",
      "rise. It was on father’s suggestion that he went to law college. He\n",
      "became a lawyer, and hardly was he back in the office when father took\n",
      "him in as junior partner. He is a great man. He refused the United\n",
      "States Senate several times, and father says he could become a justice\n",
      "of the Supreme Court any time a vacancy occurs, if he wants to. Such a\n",

      "of a woman, or for attainment of beauty, Martin would have understood.\n",
      "God’s own mad lover should do anything for the kiss, but not for thirty\n",
      "thousand dollars a year. He was dissatisfied with Mr. Butler’s career.\n",
      "There was something paltry about it, after all. Thirty thousand a year\n",
      "was all right, but dyspepsia and inability to be humanly happy robbed\n",
      "such princely income of all its value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of this he strove to express to Ruth, and shocked her and made it\n",
      "clear that more remodelling was necessary. Hers was that common\n",
      "insularity of mind that makes human creatures believe that their color,\n",
      "creed, and politics are best and right and that other human creatures\n",
      "scattered over the world are less fortunately placed than they. It was\n",
      "the same insularity of mind that made the ancient Jew thank God he was\n",
      "not born a woman, and sent the modern missionary god-substituting to\n",
      "the ends of the earth; and it made Ruth desire to shape this man from\n",

      "Back from sea Martin Eden came, homing for California with a lover’s\n",
      "desire. His store of money exhausted, he had shipped before the mast on\n",
      "the treasure-hunting schooner; and the Solomon Islands, after eight\n",
      "months of failure to find treasure, had witnessed the breaking up of\n",
      "the expedition. The men had been paid off in Australia, and Martin had\n",
      "immediately shipped on a deep-water vessel for San Francisco. Not alone\n",
      "had those eight months earned him enough money to stay on land for many\n",
      "weeks, but they had enabled him to do a great deal of studying and\n",
      "reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "His was the student’s mind, and behind his ability to learn was the\n",
      "indomitability of his nature and his love for Ruth. The grammar he had\n",
      "taken along he went through again and again until his unjaded brain had\n",
      "mastered it. He noticed the bad grammar used by his shipmates, and made\n",
      "a point of mentally correcting and reconstructing their crudities of\n",
      "speech. To his great joy he discovered that his ear was becoming\n",
      "sensitive and that he was developing grammatical nerves. A double\n",
      "negative jarred him like a discord, and often, from lack of practice,\n",
      "it was from his own lips that the jar came. His tongue refused to learn\n",
      "new tricks in a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "After he had been through the grammar repeatedly, he took up the\n",
      "dictionary and added twenty words a day to his vocabulary. He found\n",
      "that this was no light task, and at wheel or lookout he steadily went\n",
      "over and over his lengthening list of pronunciations and definitions,\n",
      "while he invariably memorized himself to sleep. “Never did anything,”\n",
      "“if I were,” and “those things,” were phrases, with many variations,\n",
      "that he repeated under his breath in order to accustom his tongue to\n",
      "the language spoken by Ruth. “And” and “ing,” with the “d” and “g”\n",
      "pronounced emphatically, he went over thousands of times; and to his\n",
      "surprise he noticed that he was beginning to speak cleaner and more\n",
      "correct English than the officers themselves and the\n",
      "gentleman-adventurers in the cabin who had financed the expedition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain was a fishy-eyed Norwegian who somehow had fallen into\n",
      "possession of a complete Shakespeare, which he never read, and Martin\n",
      "had washed his clothes for him and in return been permitted access to\n",
      "the precious volumes. For a time, so steeped was he in the plays and in\n",
      "the many favorite passages that impressed themselves almost without\n",
      "effort on his brain, that all the world seemed to shape itself into\n",
      "forms of Elizabethan tragedy or comedy and his very thoughts were in\n",
      "blank verse. It trained his ear and gave him a fine appreciation for\n",
      "noble English; withal it introduced into his mind much that was archaic\n",
      "and obsolete.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eight months had been well spent, and, in addition to what he had\n",
      "learned of right speaking and high thinking, he had learned much of\n",
      "himself. Along with his humbleness because he knew so little, there\n",
      "arose a conviction of power. He felt a sharp gradation between himself\n",
      "and his shipmates, and was wise enough to realize that the difference\n",
      "lay in potentiality rather than achievement. What he could do,—they\n",
      "could do; but within him he felt a confused ferment working that told\n",
      "him there was more in him than he had done. He was tortured by the\n",
      "exquisite beauty of the world, and wished that Ruth were there to share\n",
      "it with him. He decided that he would describe to her many of the bits\n",
      "of South Sea beauty. The creative spirit in him flamed up at the\n",
      "thought and urged that he recreate this beauty for a wider audience\n",
      "than Ruth. And then, in splendor and glory, came the great idea. He\n",
      "would write. He would be one of the eyes through which the world saw,\n",
      "one of the ears through which it heard, one of the hearts through which\n",
      "it felt. He would write—everything—poetry and prose, fiction and\n",
      "description, and plays like Shakespeare. There was career and the way\n",
      "to win to Ruth. The men of literature were the world’s giants, and he\n",
      "conceived them to be far finer than the Mr. Butlers who earned thirty\n",
      "thousand a year and could be Supreme Court justices if they wanted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the idea had germinated, it mastered him, and the return voyage to\n",
      "San Francisco was like a dream. He was drunken with unguessed power and\n",
      "felt that he could do anything. In the midst of the great and lonely\n",
      "sea he gained perspective. Clearly, and for the first time, he saw Ruth\n",
      "and her world. It was all visualized in his mind as a concrete thing\n",
      "which he could take up in his two hands and turn around and about and\n",
      "examine. There was much that was dim and nebulous in that world, but he\n",
      "saw it as a whole and not in detail, and he saw, also, the way to\n",
      "master it. To write! The thought was fire in him. He would begin as\n",
      "soon as he got back. The first thing he would do would be to describe\n",
      "the voyage of the treasure-hunters. He would sell it to some San\n",
      "Francisco newspaper. He would not tell Ruth anything about it, and she\n",
      "would be surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print. While he\n",
      "wrote, he could go on studying. There were twenty-four hours in each\n",
      "day. He was invincible. He knew how to work, and the citadels would go\n",
      "down before him. He would not have to go to sea again—as a sailor; and\n",
      "for the instant he caught a vision of a steam yacht. There were other\n",
      "writers who possessed steam yachts. Of course, he cautioned himself, it\n",
      "would be slow succeeding at first, and for a time he would be content\n",
      "to earn enough money by his writing to enable him to go on studying.\n",
      "And then, after some time,—a very indeterminate time,—when he had\n",
      "learned and prepared himself, he would write the great things and his\n",
      "name would be on all men’s lips. But greater than that, infinitely\n",
      "greater and greatest of all, he would have proved himself worthy of\n",
      "Ruth. Fame was all very well, but it was for Ruth that his splendid\n",
      "dream arose. He was not a fame-monger, but merely one of God’s mad\n",
      "lovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived in Oakland, with his snug pay-day in his pocket, he took up his\n",
      "old room at Bernard Higginbotham’s and set to work. He did not even let\n",
      "Ruth know he was back. He would go and see her when he finished the\n",
      "article on the treasure-hunters. It was not so difficult to abstain\n",
      "from seeing her, because of the violent heat of creative fever that\n",
      "burned in him. Besides, the very article he was writing would bring her\n",
      "nearer to him. He did not know how long an article he should write, but\n",
      "he counted the words in a double-page article in the Sunday supplement\n",
      "of the _San Francisco Examiner_, and guided himself by that. Three\n",
      "days, at white heat, completed his narrative; but when he had copied it\n",
      "carefully, in a large scrawl that was easy to read, he learned from a\n",
      "rhetoric he picked up in the library that there were such things as\n",
      "paragraphs and quotation marks. He had never thought of such things\n",
      "before; and he promptly set to work writing the article over, referring\n",
      "continually to the pages of the rhetoric and learning more in a day\n",
      "about composition than the average schoolboy in a year. When he had\n",
      "copied the article a second time and rolled it up carefully, he read in\n",
      "a newspaper an item on hints to beginners, and discovered the iron law\n",
      "that manuscripts should never be rolled and that they should be written\n",
      "on one side of the paper. He had violated the law on both counts. Also,\n",
      "he learned from the item that first-class papers paid a minimum of ten\n",
      "dollars a column. So, while he copied the manuscript a third time, he\n",
      "consoled himself by multiplying ten columns by ten dollars. The product\n",
      "was always the same, one hundred dollars, and he decided that that was\n",
      "better than seafaring. If it hadn’t been for his blunders, he would\n",
      "have finished the article in three days. One hundred dollars in three\n",
      "days! It would have taken him three months and longer on the sea to\n",
      "earn a similar amount. A man was a fool to go to sea when he could\n",
      "write, he concluded, though the money in itself meant nothing to him.\n",
      "Its value was in the liberty it would get him, the presentable garments\n",
      "it would buy him, all of which would bring him nearer, swiftly nearer,\n",
      "to the slender, pale girl who had turned his life back upon itself and\n",
      "given him inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "He mailed the manuscript in a flat envelope, and addressed it to the\n",
      "editor of the _San Francisco Examiner_. He had an idea that anything\n",
      "accepted by a paper was published immediately, and as he had sent the\n",
      "manuscript in on Friday he expected it to come out on the following\n",
      "Sunday. He conceived that it would be fine to let that event apprise\n",
      "Ruth of his return. Then, Sunday afternoon, he would call and see her.\n",
      "In the meantime he was occupied by another idea, which he prided\n",
      "himself upon as being a particularly sane, careful, and modest idea. He\n",
      "would write an adventure story for boys and sell it to _The Youth’s\n",
      "Companion_. He went to the free reading-room and looked through the\n",
      "files of _The Youth’s Companion_. Serial stories, he found, were\n",
      "usually published in that weekly in five instalments of about three\n",
      "thousand words each. He discovered several serials that ran to seven\n",
      "instalments, and decided to write one of that length.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been on a whaling voyage in the Arctic, once—a voyage that was\n",
      "to have been for three years and which had terminated in shipwreck at\n",
      "the end of six months. While his imagination was fanciful, even\n",
      "fantastic at times, he had a basic love of reality that compelled him\n",
      "to write about the things he knew. He knew whaling, and out of the real\n",
      "materials of his knowledge he proceeded to manufacture the fictitious\n",
      "adventures of the two boys he intended to use as joint heroes. It was\n",
      "easy work, he decided on Saturday evening. He had completed on that day\n",
      "the first instalment of three thousand words—much to the amusement of\n",
      "Jim, and to the open derision of Mr. Higginbotham, who sneered\n",

      "door, nervously racing through the many-sheeted newspaper. He went\n",
      "through it a second time, very carefully, then folded it up and left it\n",
      "where he had found it. He was glad he had not told any one about his\n",
      "article. On second thought he concluded that he had been wrong about\n",
      "the speed with which things found their way into newspaper columns.\n",

      "when he went out to the reading-room and explored magazines and\n",
      "weeklies until the place closed at ten o’clock. This was his programme\n",
      "for a week. Each day he did three thousand words, and each evening he\n",
      "puzzled his way through the magazines, taking note of the stories,\n",
      "articles, and poems that editors saw fit to publish. One thing was\n",
      "certain: What these multitudinous writers did he could do, and only\n",
      "give him time and he would do what they could not do. He was cheered to\n",
      "read in _Book News_, in a paragraph on the payment of magazine writers,\n",
      "not that Rudyard Kipling received a dollar per word, but that the\n",
      "minimum rate paid by first-class magazines was two cents a word. _The\n",
      "Youth’s Companion_ was certainly first class, and at that rate the\n",
      "three thousand words he had written that day would bring him sixty\n",
      "dollars—two months’ wages on the sea!\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday night he finished the serial, twenty-one thousand words long.\n",
      "At two cents a word, he calculated, that would bring him four hundred\n",
      "and twenty dollars. Not a bad week’s work. It was more money than he\n",
      "had ever possessed at one time. He did not know how he could spend it\n",
      "all. He had tapped a gold mine. Where this came from he could always\n",
      "get more. He planned to buy some more clothes, to subscribe to many\n",
      "magazines, and to buy dozens of reference books that at present he was\n",
      "compelled to go to the library to consult. And still there was a large\n",
      "portion of the four hundred and twenty dollars unspent. This worried\n",
      "him until the thought came to him of hiring a servant for Gertrude and\n",
      "of buying a bicycle for Marian.\n",
      "\n",
      "He mailed the bulky manuscript to _The Youth’s Companion_, and on\n",
      "Saturday afternoon, after having planned an article on pearl-diving, he\n",
      "went to see Ruth. He had telephoned, and she went herself to greet him\n",
      "at the door. The old familiar blaze of health rushed out from him and\n",
      "struck her like a blow. It seemed to enter into her body and course\n",
      "through her veins in a liquid glow, and to set her quivering with its\n",
      "imparted strength. He flushed warmly as he took her hand and looked\n",
      "into her blue eyes, but the fresh bronze of eight months of sun hid the\n",
      "flush, though it did not protect the neck from the gnawing chafe of the\n",
      "stiff collar. She noted the red line of it with amusement which quickly\n",
      "vanished as she glanced at his clothes. They really fitted him,—it was\n",
      "his first made-to-order suit,—and he seemed slimmer and better\n",
      "modelled. In addition, his cloth cap had been replaced by a soft hat,\n",
      "which she commanded him to put on and then complimented him on his\n",
      "appearance. She did not remember when she had felt so happy. This\n",
      "change in him was her handiwork, and she was proud of it and fired with\n",
      "ambition further to help him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the most radical change of all, and the one that pleased her most,\n",
      "was the change in his speech. Not only did he speak more correctly, but\n",
      "he spoke more easily, and there were many new words in his vocabulary.\n",
      "When he grew excited or enthusiastic, however, he dropped back into the\n",
      "old slurring and the dropping of final consonants. Also, there was an\n",
      "awkward hesitancy, at times, as he essayed the new words he had\n",
      "learned. On the other hand, along with his ease of expression, he\n",
      "displayed a lightness and facetiousness of thought that delighted her.\n",
      "It was his old spirit of humor and badinage that had made him a\n",
      "favorite in his own class, but which he had hitherto been unable to use\n",
      "in her presence through lack of words and training. He was just\n",
      "beginning to orientate himself and to feel that he was not wholly an\n",
      "intruder. But he was very tentative, fastidiously so, letting Ruth set\n",
      "the pace of sprightliness and fancy, keeping up with her but never\n",
      "daring to go beyond her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told her of what he had been doing, and of his plan to write for a\n",
      "livelihood and of going on with his studies. But he was disappointed at\n",
      "her lack of approval. She did not think much of his plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see,” she said frankly, “writing must be a trade, like anything\n",
      "else. Not that I know anything about it, of course. I only bring common\n",
      "judgment to bear. You couldn’t hope to be a blacksmith without spending\n",
      "three years at learning the trade—or is it five years! Now writers are\n",
      "so much better paid than blacksmiths that there must be ever so many\n",
      "more men who would like to write, who—try to write.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But then, may not I be peculiarly constituted to write?” he queried,\n",
      "secretly exulting at the language he had used, his swift imagination\n",
      "throwing the whole scene and atmosphere upon a vast screen along with a\n",
      "thousand other scenes from his life—scenes that were rough and raw,\n",
      "gross and bestial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole composite vision was achieved with the speed of light,\n",
      "producing no pause in the conversation, nor interrupting his calm train\n",
      "of thought. On the screen of his imagination he saw himself and this\n",
      "sweet and beautiful girl, facing each other and conversing in good\n",
      "English, in a room of books and paintings and tone and culture, and all\n",
      "illuminated by a bright light of steadfast brilliance; while ranged\n",
      "about and fading away to the remote edges of the screen were\n",
      "antithetical scenes, each scene a picture, and he the onlooker, free to\n",
      "look at will upon what he wished. He saw these other scenes through\n",
      "drifting vapors and swirls of sullen fog dissolving before shafts of\n",
      "red and garish light. He saw cowboys at the bar, drinking fierce\n",
      "whiskey, the air filled with obscenity and ribald language, and he saw\n",
      "himself with them drinking and cursing with the wildest, or sitting at\n",
      "table with them, under smoking kerosene lamps, while the chips clicked\n",
      "and clattered and the cards were dealt around. He saw himself, stripped\n",
      "to the waist, with naked fists, fighting his great fight with Liverpool\n",
      "Red in the forecastle of the _Susquehanna_; and he saw the bloody deck\n",
      "of the _John Rogers_, that gray morning of attempted mutiny, the mate\n",
      "kicking in death-throes on the main-hatch, the revolver in the old\n",
      "man’s hand spitting fire and smoke, the men with passion-wrenched\n",
      "faces, of brutes screaming vile blasphemies and falling about him—and\n",
      "then he returned to the central scene, calm and clean in the steadfast\n",
      "light, where Ruth sat and talked with him amid books and paintings; and\n",
      "he saw the grand piano upon which she would later play to him; and he\n",
      "heard the echoes of his own selected and correct words, “But then, may\n",
      "I not be peculiarly constituted to write?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But no matter how peculiarly constituted a man may be for\n",
      "blacksmithing,” she was laughing, “I never heard of one becoming a\n",
      "blacksmith without first serving his apprenticeship.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What would you advise?” he asked. “And don’t forget that I feel in me\n",
      "this capacity to write—I can’t explain it; I just know that it is in\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must get a thorough education,” was the answer, “whether or not\n",
      "you ultimately become a writer. This education is indispensable for\n",
      "whatever career you select, and it must not be slipshod or sketchy. You\n",
      "should go to high school.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes—” he began; but she interrupted with an afterthought:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course, you could go on with your writing, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would have to,” he said grimly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” She looked at him, prettily puzzled, for she did not quite like\n",
      "the persistence with which he clung to his notion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because, without writing there wouldn’t be any high school. I must\n",
      "live and buy books and clothes, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d forgotten that,” she laughed. “Why weren’t you born with an\n",
      "income?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d rather have good health and imagination,” he answered. “I can make\n",
      "good on the income, but the other things have to be made good for—” He\n",
      "almost said “you,” then amended his sentence to, “have to be made good\n",
      "for one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t say ‘make good,’” she cried, sweetly petulant. “It’s slang, and\n",
      "it’s horrid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He flushed, and stammered, “That’s right, and I only wish you’d correct\n",
      "me every time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I—I’d like to,” she said haltingly. “You have so much in you that is\n",
      "good that I want to see you perfect.”\n",

      "He was clay in her hands immediately, as passionately desirous of being\n",
      "moulded by her as she was desirous of shaping him into the image of her\n",
      "ideal of man. And when she pointed out the opportuneness of the time,\n",
      "that the entrance examinations to high school began on the following\n",
      "Monday, he promptly volunteered that he would take them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she played and sang to him, while he gazed with hungry yearning at\n",

      "\n",
      "He stopped to dinner that evening, and, much to Ruth’s satisfaction,\n",
      "made a favorable impression on her father. They talked about the sea as\n",
      "a career, a subject which Martin had at his finger-ends, and Mr. Morse\n",
      "remarked afterward that he seemed a very clear-headed young man. In his\n",
      "avoidance of slang and his search after right words, Martin was\n",
      "compelled to talk slowly, which enabled him to find the best thoughts\n",
      "that were in him. He was more at ease than that first night at dinner,\n",
      "nearly a year before, and his shyness and modesty even commended him to\n",
      "Mrs. Morse, who was pleased at his manifest improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is the first man that ever drew passing notice from Ruth,” she told\n",
      "her husband. “She has been so singularly backward where men are\n",
      "concerned that I have been worried greatly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Morse looked at his wife curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean to use this young sailor to wake her up?” he questioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean that she is not to die an old maid if I can help it,” was the\n",
      "answer. “If this young Eden can arouse her interest in mankind in\n",
      "general, it will be a good thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A very good thing,” he commented. “But suppose,—and we must suppose,\n",
      "sometimes, my dear,—suppose he arouses her interest too particularly in\n",
      "him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Impossible,” Mrs. Morse laughed. “She is three years older than he,\n",
      "and, besides, it is impossible. Nothing will ever come of it. Trust\n",
      "that to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so Martin’s rôle was arranged for him, while he, led on by Arthur\n",
      "and Norman, was meditating an extravagance. They were going out for a\n",
      "ride into the hills Sunday morning on their wheels, which did not\n",
      "interest Martin until he learned that Ruth, too, rode a wheel and was\n",
      "going along. He did not ride, nor own a wheel, but if Ruth rode, it was\n",
      "up to him to begin, was his decision; and when he said good night, he\n",
      "stopped in at a cyclery on his way home and spent forty dollars for a\n",
      "wheel. It was more than a month’s hard-earned wages, and it reduced his\n",
      "stock of money amazingly; but when he added the hundred dollars he was\n",
      "to receive from the _Examiner_ to the four hundred and twenty dollars\n",
      "that was the least _The Youth’s Companion_ could pay him, he felt that\n",
      "he had reduced the perplexity the unwonted amount of money had caused\n",
      "him. Nor did he mind, in the course of learning to ride the wheel home,\n",
      "the fact that he ruined his suit of clothes. He caught the tailor by\n",
      "telephone that night from Mr. Higginbotham’s store and ordered another\n",
      "suit. Then he carried the wheel up the narrow stairway that clung like\n",
      "a fire-escape to the rear wall of the building, and when he had moved\n",
      "his bed out from the wall, found there was just space enough in the\n",
      "small room for himself and the wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday he had intended to devote to studying for the high school\n",
      "examination, but the pearl-diving article lured him away, and he spent\n",
      "the day in the white-hot fever of re-creating the beauty and romance\n",
      "that burned in him. The fact that the _Examiner_ of that morning had\n",
      "failed to publish his treasure-hunting article did not dash his\n",
      "spirits. He was at too great a height for that, and having been deaf to\n",
      "a twice-repeated summons, he went without the heavy Sunday dinner with\n",
      "which Mr. Higginbotham invariably graced his table. To Mr. Higginbotham\n",
      "such a dinner was advertisement of his worldly achievement and\n",
      "prosperity, and he honored it by delivering platitudinous sermonettes\n",
      "upon American institutions and the opportunity said institutions gave\n",
      "to any hard-working man to rise—the rise, in his case, which he pointed\n",
      "out unfailingly, being from a grocer’s clerk to the ownership of\n",
      "Higginbotham’s Cash Store.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin Eden looked with a sigh at his unfinished “Pearl-diving” on\n",
      "Monday morning, and took the car down to Oakland to the high school.\n",
      "And when, days later, he applied for the results of his examinations,\n",
      "he learned that he had failed in everything save grammar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your grammar is excellent,” Professor Hilton informed him, staring at\n",
      "him through heavy spectacles; “but you know nothing, positively\n",
      "nothing, in the other branches, and your United States history is\n",
      "abominable—there is no other word for it, abominable. I should advise\n",
      "you—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor Hilton paused and glared at him, unsympathetic and\n",
      "unimaginative as one of his own test-tubes. He was professor of physics\n",
      "in the high school, possessor of a large family, a meagre salary, and a\n",
      "select fund of parrot-learned knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir,” Martin said humbly, wishing somehow that the man at the\n",
      "desk in the library was in Professor Hilton’s place just then.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I should advise you to go back to the grammar school for at least\n",
      "two years. Good day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin was not deeply affected by his failure, though he was surprised\n",
      "at Ruth’s shocked expression when he told her Professor Hilton’s\n",
      "advice. Her disappointment was so evident that he was sorry he had\n",
      "failed, but chiefly so for her sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see I was right,” she said. “You know far more than any of the\n",
      "students entering high school, and yet you can’t pass the examinations.\n",
      "It is because what education you have is fragmentary, sketchy. You need\n",
      "the discipline of study, such as only skilled teachers can give you.\n",
      "You must be thoroughly grounded. Professor Hilton is right, and if I\n",
      "were you, I’d go to night school. A year and a half of it might enable\n",
      "you to catch up that additional six months. Besides, that would leave\n",
      "you your days in which to write, or, if you could not make your living\n",
      "by your pen, you would have your days in which to work in some\n",
      "position.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But if my days are taken up with work and my nights with school, when\n",
      "am I going to see you?—was Martin’s first thought, though he refrained\n",
      "from uttering it. Instead, he said:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“It seems so babyish for me to be going to night school. But I wouldn’t\n",
      "mind that if I thought it would pay. But I don’t think it will pay. I\n",
      "can do the work quicker than they can teach me. It would be a loss of\n",
      "time—” he thought of her and his desire to have her—“and I can’t afford\n",
      "the time. I haven’t the time to spare, in fact.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is so much that is necessary.” She looked at him gently, and he\n",
      "was a brute to oppose her. “Physics and chemistry—you can’t do them\n",
      "without laboratory study; and you’ll find algebra and geometry almost\n",
      "hopeless without instruction. You need the skilled teachers, the\n",
      "specialists in the art of imparting knowledge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was silent for a minute, casting about for the least vainglorious\n",
      "way in which to express himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please don’t think I’m bragging,” he began. “I don’t intend it that\n",
      "way at all. But I have a feeling that I am what I may call a natural\n",
      "student. I can study by myself. I take to it kindly, like a duck to\n",
      "water. You see yourself what I did with grammar. And I’ve learned much\n",
      "of other things—you would never dream how much. And I’m only getting\n",
      "started. Wait till I get—” He hesitated and assured himself of the\n",
      "pronunciation before he said “momentum. I’m getting my first real feel\n",
      "of things now. I’m beginning to size up the situation—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please don’t say ‘size up,’” she interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To get a line on things,” he hastily amended.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That doesn’t mean anything in correct English,” she objected.\n",
      "\n",
      "He floundered for a fresh start.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I’m driving at is that I’m beginning to get the lay of the land.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of pity she forebore, and he went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Knowledge seems to me like a chart-room. Whenever I go into the\n",
      "library, I am impressed that way. The part played by teachers is to\n",
      "teach the student the contents of the chart-room in a systematic way.\n",
      "The teachers are guides to the chart-room, that’s all. It’s not\n",
      "something that they have in their own heads. They don’t make it up,\n",
      "don’t create it. It’s all in the chart-room and they know their way\n",
      "about in it, and it’s their business to show the place to strangers who\n",
      "might else get lost. Now I don’t get lost easily. I have the bump of\n",
      "location. I usually know where I’m at—What’s wrong now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t say ‘where I’m at.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s right,” he said gratefully, “where I am. But where am I at—I\n",
      "mean, where am I? Oh, yes, in the chart-room. Well, some people—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Persons,” she corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some persons need guides, most persons do; but I think I can get along\n",
      "without them. I’ve spent a lot of time in the chart-room now, and I’m\n",
      "on the edge of knowing my way about, what charts I want to refer to,\n",
      "what coasts I want to explore. And from the way I line it up, I’ll\n",
      "explore a whole lot more quickly by myself. The speed of a fleet, you\n",
      "know, is the speed of the slowest ship, and the speed of the teachers\n",
      "is affected the same way. They can’t go any faster than the ruck of\n",
      "their scholars, and I can set a faster pace for myself than they set\n",
      "for a whole schoolroom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘He travels the fastest who travels alone,’” she quoted at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’d travel faster with you just the same, was what he wanted to\n",
      "blurt out, as he caught a vision of a world without end of sunlit\n",
      "spaces and starry voids through which he drifted with her, his arm\n",
      "around her, her pale gold hair blowing about his face. In the same\n",
      "instant he was aware of the pitiful inadequacy of speech. God! If he\n",
      "could so frame words that she could see what he then saw! And he felt\n",
      "the stir in him, like a throe of yearning pain, of the desire to paint\n",
      "these visions that flashed unsummoned on the mirror of his mind. Ah,\n",
      "that was it! He caught at the hem of the secret. It was the very thing\n",
      "that the great writers and master-poets did. That was why they were\n",
      "giants. They knew how to express what they thought, and felt, and saw.\n",
      "Dogs asleep in the sun often whined and barked, but they were unable to\n",
      "tell what they saw that made them whine and bark. He had often wondered\n",
      "what it was. And that was all he was, a dog asleep in the sun. He saw\n",
      "noble and beautiful visions, but he could only whine and bark at Ruth.\n",
      "But he would cease sleeping in the sun. He would stand up, with open\n",
      "eyes, and he would struggle and toil and learn until, with eyes\n",
      "unblinded and tongue untied, he could share with her his visioned\n",
      "wealth. Other men had discovered the trick of expression, of making\n",
      "words obedient servitors, and of making combinations of words mean more\n",
      "than the sum of their separate meanings. He was stirred profoundly by\n",
      "the passing glimpse at the secret, and he was again caught up in the\n",

      "spirit of adventure lured him more strongly than on this amazing\n",
      "exploration of the realm of mind. He bought the text-books on physics\n",
      "and chemistry, and, along with his algebra, worked out problems and\n",

      "understandingly than the average student saw them in the laboratory.\n",
      "Martin wandered on through the heavy pages, overwhelmed by the clews he\n",

      "world, but now he was comprehending the organization of it, the play\n",
      "and interplay of force and matter. Spontaneous explanations of old\n",
      "matters were continually arising in his mind. Levers and purchases\n",
      "fascinated him, and his mind roved backward to hand-spikes and blocks\n",
      "and tackles at sea. The theory of navigation, which enabled the ships\n",
      "to travel unerringly their courses over the pathless ocean, was made\n",
      "clear to him. The mysteries of storm, and rain, and tide were revealed,\n",

      "demonstrations, and listened to a physics professor lecturing to his\n",
      "classes.\n",

      "kind he saw printed in the magazines—though he lost his head and wasted\n",
      "two weeks on a tragedy in blank verse, the swift rejection of which, by\n",
      "half a dozen magazines, dumfounded him. Then he discovered Henley and\n",
      "wrote a series of sea-poems on the model of “Hospital Sketches.” They\n",
      "were simple poems, of light and color, and romance and adventure. “Sea\n",
      "Lyrics,” he called them, and he judged them to be the best work he had\n",
      "yet done. There were thirty, and he completed them in a month, doing\n",
      "one a day after having done his regular day’s work on fiction, which\n",
      "day’s work was the equivalent to a week’s work of the average\n",
      "successful writer. The toil meant nothing to him. It was not toil. He\n",
      "was finding speech, and all the beauty and wonder that had been pent\n",
      "for years behind his inarticulate lips was now pouring forth in a wild\n",
      "and virile flood.\n",
      "\n",
      "He showed the “Sea Lyrics” to no one, not even to the editors. He had\n",
      "become distrustful of editors. But it was not distrust that prevented\n",
      "him from submitting the “Lyrics.” They were so beautiful to him that he\n",
      "was impelled to save them to share with Ruth in some glorious, far-off\n",
      "time when he would dare to read to her what he had written. Against\n",
      "that time he kept them with him, reading them aloud, going over them\n",

      "his subjective mind rioting through his five hours of surcease and\n",
      "combining the thoughts and events of the day into grotesque and\n",
      "impossible marvels. In reality, he never rested, and a weaker body or a\n",
      "less firmly poised brain would have been prostrated in a general\n",
      "break-down. His late afternoon calls on Ruth were rarer now, for June\n",
      "was approaching, when she would take her degree and finish with the\n",

      "\n",
      "One afternoon a week she gave to him, and arriving late, he usually\n",
      "stayed for dinner and for music afterward. Those were his red-letter\n",
      "days. The atmosphere of the house, in such contrast with that in which\n",
      "he lived, and the mere nearness to her, sent him forth each time with a\n",
      "firmer grip on his resolve to climb the heights. In spite of the beauty\n",
      "in him, and the aching desire to create, it was for her that he\n",
      "struggled. He was a lover first and always. All other things he\n",
      "subordinated to love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greater than his adventure in the world of thought was his\n",
      "love-adventure. The world itself was not so amazing because of the\n",
      "atoms and molecules that composed it according to the propulsions of\n",
      "irresistible force; what made it amazing was the fact that Ruth lived\n",
      "in it. She was the most amazing thing he had ever known, or dreamed, or\n",
      "guessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was oppressed always by her remoteness. She was so far from him,\n",
      "and he did not know how to approach her. He had been a success with\n",
      "girls and women in his own class; but he had never loved any of them,\n",
      "while he did love her, and besides, she was not merely of another\n",
      "class. His very love elevated her above all classes. She was a being\n",
      "apart, so far apart that he did not know how to draw near to her as a\n",
      "lover should draw near. It was true, as he acquired knowledge and\n",
      "language, that he was drawing nearer, talking her speech, discovering\n",
      "ideas and delights in common; but this did not satisfy his lover’s\n",
      "yearning. His lover’s imagination had made her holy, too holy, too\n",
      "spiritualized, to have any kinship with him in the flesh. It was his\n",
      "own love that thrust her from him and made her seem impossible for him.\n",

      "And then, one day, without warning, the gulf between them was bridged\n",
      "for a moment, and thereafter, though the gulf remained, it was ever\n",
      "narrower. They had been eating cherries—great, luscious, black cherries\n",
      "with a juice of the color of dark wine. And later, as she read aloud to\n",
      "him from “The Princess,” he chanced to notice the stain of the cherries\n",
      "on her lips. For the moment her divinity was shattered. She was clay,\n",
      "after all, mere clay, subject to the common law of clay as his clay was\n",
      "subject, or anybody’s clay. Her lips were flesh like his, and cherries\n",
      "dyed them as cherries dyed his. And if so with her lips, then was it so\n",
      "with all of her. She was woman, all woman, just like any woman. It came\n",
      "upon him abruptly. It was a revelation that stunned him. It was as if\n",
      "he had seen the sun fall out of the sky, or had seen worshipped purity\n",
      "polluted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he realized the significance of it, and his heart began pounding\n",
      "and challenging him to play the lover with this woman who was not a\n",
      "spirit from other worlds but a mere woman with lips a cherry could\n",
      "stain. He trembled at the audacity of his thought; but all his soul was\n",
      "singing, and reason, in a triumphant paean, assured him he was right.\n",
      "Something of this change in him must have reached her, for she paused\n",
      "from her reading, looked up at him, and smiled. His eyes dropped from\n",
      "her blue eyes to her lips, and the sight of the stain maddened him. His\n",
      "arms all but flashed out to her and around her, in the way of his old\n",
      "careless life. She seemed to lean toward him, to wait, and all his will\n",
      "fought to hold him back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were not following a word,” she pouted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she laughed at him, delighting in his confusion, and as he looked\n",
      "into her frank eyes and knew that she had divined nothing of what he\n",
      "felt, he became abashed. He had indeed in thought dared too far. Of all\n",
      "the women he had known there was no woman who would not have\n",
      "guessed—save her. And she had not guessed. There was the difference.\n",
      "She was different. He was appalled by his own grossness, awed by her\n",
      "clear innocence, and he gazed again at her across the gulf. The bridge\n",
      "had broken down.\n",
      "\n",
      "But still the incident had brought him nearer. The memory of it\n",
      "persisted, and in the moments when he was most cast down, he dwelt upon\n",
      "it eagerly. The gulf was never again so wide. He had accomplished a\n",
      "distance vastly greater than a bachelorship of arts, or a dozen\n",
      "bachelorships. She was pure, it was true, as he had never dreamed of\n",
      "purity; but cherries stained her lips. She was subject to the laws of\n",
      "the universe just as inexorably as he was. She had to eat to live, and\n",
      "when she got her feet wet, she caught cold. But that was not the point.\n",
      "If she could feel hunger and thirst, and heat and cold, then could she\n",
      "feel love—and love for a man. Well, he was a man. And why could he not\n",

      "his whirling brain. He loved her so much, so terribly, so hopelessly.\n",
      "In that moment of mad happiness that she should go out with him, go to\n",
      "a lecture with him—with him, Martin Eden—she soared so far above him\n",
      "that there seemed nothing else for him to do than die for her. It was\n",
      "the only fit way in which he could express the tremendous and lofty\n",
      "emotion he felt for her. It was the sublime abnegation of true love\n",
      "that comes to all lovers, and it came to him there, at the telephone,\n",
      "in a whirlwind of fire and glory; and to die for her, he felt, was to\n",
      "have lived and loved well. And he was only twenty-one, and he had never\n",
      "been in love before.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hand trembled as he hung up the receiver, and he was weak from the\n",
      "organ which had stirred him. His eyes were shining like an angel’s, and\n",
      "his face was transfigured, purged of all earthly dross, and pure and\n",
      "holy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Makin’ dates outside, eh?” his brother-in-law sneered. “You know what\n",
      "that means. You’ll be in the police court yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Martin could not come down from the height. Not even the bestiality\n",
      "of the allusion could bring him back to earth. Anger and hurt were\n",
      "beneath him. He had seen a great vision and was as a god, and he could\n",
      "feel only profound and awful pity for this maggot of a man. He did not\n",
      "look at him, and though his eyes passed over him, he did not see him;\n",
      "and as in a dream he passed out of the room to dress. It was not until\n",
      "he had reached his own room and was tying his necktie that he became\n",
      "aware of a sound that lingered unpleasantly in his ears. On\n",
      "investigating this sound he identified it as the final snort of Bernard\n",
      "Higginbotham, which somehow had not penetrated to his brain before.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Ruth’s front door closed behind them and he came down the steps with\n",
      "her, he found himself greatly perturbed. It was not unalloyed bliss,\n",
      "taking her to the lecture. He did not know what he ought to do. He had\n",
      "seen, on the streets, with persons of her class, that the women took\n",
      "the men’s arms. But then, again, he had seen them when they didn’t; and\n",
      "he wondered if it was only in the evening that arms were taken, or only\n",
      "between husbands and wives and relatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just before he reached the sidewalk, he remembered Minnie. Minnie had\n",
      "always been a stickler. She had called him down the second time she\n",
      "walked out with him, because he had gone along on the inside, and she\n",
      "had laid the law down to him that a gentleman always walked on the\n",
      "outside—when he was with a lady. And Minnie had made a practice of\n",
      "kicking his heels, whenever they crossed from one side of the street to\n",
      "the other, to remind him to get over on the outside. He wondered where\n",
      "she had got that item of etiquette, and whether it had filtered down\n",
      "from above and was all right.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wouldn’t do any harm to try it, he decided, by the time they had\n",
      "reached the sidewalk; and he swung behind Ruth and took up his station\n",
      "on the outside. Then the other problem presented itself. Should he\n",
      "offer her his arm? He had never offered anybody his arm in his life.\n",
      "The girls he had known never took the fellows’ arms. For the first\n",
      "several times they walked freely, side by side, and after that it was\n",
      "arms around the waists, and heads against the fellows’ shoulders where\n",
      "the streets were unlighted. But this was different. She wasn’t that\n",
      "kind of a girl. He must do something.\n",
      "\n",
      "He crooked the arm next to her—crooked it very slightly and with secret\n",
      "tentativeness, not invitingly, but just casually, as though he was\n",
      "accustomed to walk that way. And then the wonderful thing happened. He\n",
      "felt her hand upon his arm. Delicious thrills ran through him at the\n",
      "contact, and for a few sweet moments it seemed that he had left the\n",
      "solid earth and was flying with her through the air. But he was soon\n",
      "back again, perturbed by a new complication. They were crossing the\n",
      "street. This would put him on the inside. He should be on the outside.\n",
      "Should he therefore drop her arm and change over? And if he did so,\n",
      "would he have to repeat the manoeuvre the next time? And the next?\n",
      "There was something wrong about it, and he resolved not to caper about\n",
      "and play the fool. Yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion, and\n",
      "when he found himself on the inside, he talked quickly and earnestly,\n",
      "making a show of being carried away by what he was saying, so that, in\n",
      "case he was wrong in not changing sides, his enthusiasm would seem the\n",
      "cause for his carelessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they crossed Broadway, he came face to face with a new problem. In\n",
      "the blaze of the electric lights, he saw Lizzie Connolly and her giggly\n",
      "friend. Only for an instant he hesitated, then his hand went up and his\n",
      "hat came off. He could not be disloyal to his kind, and it was to more\n",
      "than Lizzie Connolly that his hat was lifted. She nodded and looked at\n",
      "him boldly, not with soft and gentle eyes like Ruth’s, but with eyes\n",
      "that were handsome and hard, and that swept on past him to Ruth and\n",
      "itemized her face and dress and station. And he was aware that Ruth\n",
      "looked, too, with quick eyes that were timid and mild as a dove’s, but\n",
      "which saw, in a look that was a flutter on and past, the working-class\n",
      "girl in her cheap finery and under the strange hat that all\n",
      "working-class girls were wearing just then.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a pretty girl!” Ruth said a moment later.\n",
      "\n",

      "“I don’t know. I guess it’s all a matter of personal taste, but she\n",
      "doesn’t strike me as being particularly pretty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, there isn’t one woman in ten thousand with features as regular as\n",

      "eyes are beautiful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think so?” Martin queried absently, for to him there was only\n",

      "\n",
      "“Do I think so? If that girl had proper opportunity to dress, Mr. Eden,\n",
      "and if she were taught how to carry herself, you would be fairly\n",
      "dazzled by her, and so would all men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She would have to be taught how to speak,” he commented, “or else most\n",

      "I can manage to make myself understood sufficiently in your language to\n",
      "explain that you do not know that other girl’s language. And do you\n",
      "know why she carries herself the way she does? I think about such\n",
      "things now, though I never used to think about them, and I am beginning\n",
      "to understand—much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why does she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She has worked long hours for years at machines. When one’s body is\n",
      "young, it is very pliable, and hard work will mould it like putty\n",
      "according to the nature of the work. I can tell at a glance the trades\n",
      "of many workingmen I meet on the street. Look at me. Why am I rolling\n",
      "all about the shop? Because of the years I put in on the sea. If I’d\n",
      "put in the same years cow-punching, with my body young and pliable, I\n",
      "wouldn’t be rolling now, but I’d be bow-legged. And so with that girl.\n",
      "You noticed that her eyes were what I might call hard. She has never\n",
      "been sheltered. She has had to take care of herself, and a young girl\n",

      "Who are you, Martin Eden? he demanded of himself in the looking-glass,\n",
      "that night when he got back to his room. He gazed at himself long and\n",
      "curiously. Who are you? What are you? Where do you belong? You belong\n",
      "by rights to girls like Lizzie Connolly. You belong with the legions of\n",
      "toil, with all that is low, and vulgar, and unbeautiful. You belong\n",
      "with the oxen and the drudges, in dirty surroundings among smells and\n",
      "stenches. There are the stale vegetables now. Those potatoes are\n",
      "rotting. Smell them, damn you, smell them. And yet you dare to open the\n",
      "books, to listen to beautiful music, to learn to love beautiful\n",
      "paintings, to speak good English, to think thoughts that none of your\n",
      "own kind thinks, to tear yourself away from the oxen and the Lizzie\n",
      "Connollys and to love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles\n",

      "He shook his fist at himself in the glass, and sat down on the edge of\n",
      "the bed to dream for a space with wide eyes. Then he got out note-book\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the knot of wordy socialists and working-class philosophers that\n",
      "held forth in the City Hall Park on warm afternoons that was\n",
      "responsible for the great discovery. Once or twice in the month, while\n",
      "riding through the park on his way to the library, Martin dismounted\n",
      "from his wheel and listened to the arguments, and each time he tore\n",
      "himself away reluctantly. The tone of discussion was much lower than at\n",
      "Mr. Morse’s table. The men were not grave and dignified. They lost\n",
      "their tempers easily and called one another names, while oaths and\n",
      "obscene allusions were frequent on their lips. Once or twice he had\n",
      "seen them come to blows. And yet, he knew not why, there seemed\n",
      "something vital about the stuff of these men’s thoughts. Their\n",
      "logomachy was far more stimulating to his intellect than the reserved\n",
      "and quiet dogmatism of Mr. Morse. These men, who slaughtered English,\n",
      "gesticulated like lunatics, and fought one another’s ideas with\n",
      "primitive anger, seemed somehow to be more alive than Mr. Morse and his\n",
      "crony, Mr. Butler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin had heard Herbert Spencer quoted several times in the park, but\n",
      "one afternoon a disciple of Spencer’s appeared, a seedy tramp with a\n",
      "dirty coat buttoned tightly at the throat to conceal the absence of a\n",
      "shirt. Battle royal was waged, amid the smoking of many cigarettes and\n",
      "the expectoration of much tobacco-juice, wherein the tramp successfully\n",
      "held his own, even when a socialist workman sneered, “There is no god\n",
      "but the Unknowable, and Herbert Spencer is his prophet.” Martin was\n",
      "puzzled as to what the discussion was about, but when he rode on to the\n",
      "library he carried with him a new-born interest in Herbert Spencer, and\n",
      "because of the frequency with which the tramp had mentioned “First\n",
      "Principles,” Martin drew out that volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the great discovery began. Once before he had tried Spencer, and\n",
      "choosing the “Principles of Psychology” to begin with, he had failed as\n",
      "abjectly as he had failed with Madam Blavatsky. There had been no\n",
      "understanding the book, and he had returned it unread. But this night,\n",
      "after algebra and physics, and an attempt at a sonnet, he got into bed\n",
      "and opened “First Principles.” Morning found him still reading. It was\n",
      "impossible for him to sleep. Nor did he write that day. He lay on the\n",
      "bed till his body grew tired, when he tried the hard floor, reading on\n",
      "his back, the book held in the air above him, or changing from side to\n",
      "side. He slept that night, and did his writing next morning, and then\n",
      "the book tempted him and he fell, reading all afternoon, oblivious to\n",
      "everything and oblivious to the fact that that was the afternoon Ruth\n",
      "gave to him. His first consciousness of the immediate world about him\n",
      "was when Bernard Higginbotham jerked open the door and demanded to know\n",
      "if he thought they were running a restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin Eden had been mastered by curiosity all his days. He wanted to\n",
      "know, and it was this desire that had sent him adventuring over the\n",
      "world. But he was now learning from Spencer that he never had known,\n",
      "and that he never could have known had he continued his sailing and\n",
      "wandering forever. He had merely skimmed over the surface of things,\n",
      "observing detached phenomena, accumulating fragments of facts, making\n",
      "superficial little generalizations—and all and everything quite\n",
      "unrelated in a capricious and disorderly world of whim and chance. The\n",
      "mechanism of the flight of birds he had watched and reasoned about with\n",
      "understanding; but it had never entered his head to try to explain the\n",
      "process whereby birds, as organic flying mechanisms, had been\n",
      "developed. He had never dreamed there was such a process. That birds\n",
      "should have come to be, was unguessed. They always had been. They just\n",
      "happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as it was with birds, so had it been with everything. His ignorant\n",
      "and unprepared attempts at philosophy had been fruitless. The medieval\n",
      "metaphysics of Kant had given him the key to nothing, and had served\n",
      "the sole purpose of making him doubt his own intellectual powers. In\n",
      "similar manner his attempt to study evolution had been confined to a\n",
      "hopelessly technical volume by Romanes. He had understood nothing, and\n",
      "the only idea he had gathered was that evolution was a dry-as-dust\n",
      "theory, of a lot of little men possessed of huge and unintelligible\n",
      "vocabularies. And now he learned that evolution was no mere theory but\n",
      "an accepted process of development; that scientists no longer disagreed\n",
      "about it, their only differences being over the method of evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "And here was the man Spencer, organizing all knowledge for him,\n",
      "reducing everything to unity, elaborating ultimate realities, and\n",
      "presenting to his startled gaze a universe so concrete of realization\n",
      "that it was like the model of a ship such as sailors make and put into\n",
      "glass bottles. There was no caprice, no chance. All was law. It was in\n",
      "obedience to law that the bird flew, and it was in obedience to the\n",
      "same law that fermenting slime had writhed and squirmed and put out\n",
      "legs and wings and become a bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living, and\n",
      "here he was at a higher pitch than ever. All the hidden things were\n",
      "laying their secrets bare. He was drunken with comprehension. At night,\n",
      "asleep, he lived with the gods in colossal nightmare; and awake, in the\n",
      "day, he went around like a somnambulist, with absent stare, gazing upon\n",
      "the world he had just discovered. At table he failed to hear the\n",
      "conversation about petty and ignoble things, his eager mind seeking out\n",
      "and following cause and effect in everything before him. In the meat on\n",
      "the platter he saw the shining sun and traced its energy back through\n",
      "all its transformations to its source a hundred million miles away, or\n",
      "traced its energy ahead to the moving muscles in his arms that enabled\n",
      "him to cut the meat, and to the brain wherewith he willed the muscles\n",
      "to move to cut the meat, until, with inward gaze, he saw the same sun\n",
      "shining in his brain. He was entranced by illumination, and did not\n",
      "hear the “Bughouse,” whispered by Jim, nor see the anxiety on his\n",
      "sister’s face, nor notice the rotary motion of Bernard Higginbotham’s\n",
      "finger, whereby he imparted the suggestion of wheels revolving in his\n",
      "brother-in-law’s head.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, in a way, most profoundly impressed Martin, was the correlation\n",
      "of knowledge—of all knowledge. He had been curious to know things, and\n",
      "whatever he acquired he had filed away in separate memory compartments\n",
      "in his brain. Thus, on the subject of sailing he had an immense store.\n",
      "On the subject of woman he had a fairly large store. But these two\n",
      "subjects had been unrelated. Between the two memory compartments there\n",
      "had been no connection. That, in the fabric of knowledge, there should\n",
      "be any connection whatever between a woman with hysterics and a\n",
      "schooner carrying a weather-helm or heaving to in a gale, would have\n",
      "struck him as ridiculous and impossible. But Herbert Spencer had shown\n",
      "him not only that it was not ridiculous, but that it was impossible for\n",
      "there to be no connection. All things were related to all other things\n",
      "from the farthermost star in the wastes of space to the myriads of\n",
      "atoms in the grain of sand under one’s foot. This new concept was a\n",
      "perpetual amazement to Martin, and he found himself engaged continually\n",
      "in tracing the relationship between all things under the sun and on the\n",
      "other side of the sun. He drew up lists of the most incongruous things\n",
      "and was unhappy until he succeeded in establishing kinship between them\n",
      "all—kinship between love, poetry, earthquake, fire, rattlesnakes,\n",
      "rainbows, precious gems, monstrosities, sunsets, the roaring of lions,\n",
      "illuminating gas, cannibalism, beauty, murder, lovers, fulcrums, and\n",
      "tobacco. Thus, he unified the universe and held it up and looked at it,\n",
      "or wandered through its byways and alleys and jungles, not as a\n",
      "terrified traveller in the thick of mysteries seeking an unknown goal,\n",
      "but observing and charting and becoming familiar with all there was to\n",
      "know. And the more he knew, the more passionately he admired the\n",
      "universe, and life, and his own life in the midst of it all.\n",

      "“You fool!” he cried at his image in the looking-glass. “You wanted to\n",

      "about. What did you have in you?—some childish notions, a few\n",
      "half-baked sentiments, a lot of undigested beauty, a great black mass\n",
      "of ignorance, a heart filled to bursting with love, and an ambition as\n",
      "big as your love and as futile as your ignorance. And you wanted to\n",

      "the use of the grammar he had studied so hard. He had abandoned the\n",
      "etiquette books, falling back upon observation to show him the right\n",
      "things to do. Except when carried away by his enthusiasm, he was always\n",
      "on guard, keenly watchful of their actions and learning their little\n",
      "courtesies and refinements of conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that Spencer was very little read was for some time a source\n",
      "of surprise to Martin. “Herbert Spencer,” said the man at the desk in\n",
      "the library, “oh, yes, a great mind.” But the man did not seem to know\n",
      "anything of the content of that great mind. One evening, at dinner,\n",
      "when Mr. Butler was there, Martin turned the conversation upon Spencer.\n",
      "Mr. Morse bitterly arraigned the English philosopher’s agnosticism, but\n",
      "confessed that he had not read “First Principles”; while Mr. Butler\n",
      "stated that he had no patience with Spencer, had never read a line of\n",
      "him, and had managed to get along quite well without him. Doubts arose\n",
      "in Martin’s mind, and had he been less strongly individual he would\n",
      "have accepted the general opinion and given Herbert Spencer up. As it\n",
      "was, he found Spencer’s explanation of things convincing; and, as he\n",
      "phrased it to himself, to give up Spencer would be equivalent to a\n",
      "navigator throwing the compass and chronometer overboard. So Martin\n",
      "went on into a thorough study of evolution, mastering more and more the\n",
      "subject himself, and being convinced by the corroborative testimony of\n",
      "a thousand independent writers. The more he studied, the more vistas he\n",
      "caught of fields of knowledge yet unexplored, and the regret that days\n",
      "were only twenty-four hours long became a chronic complaint with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, because the days were so short, he decided to give up algebra\n",
      "and geometry. Trigonometry he had not even attempted. Then he cut\n",
      "chemistry from his study-list, retaining only physics.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not a specialist,” he said, in defence, to Ruth. “Nor am I going\n",
      "to try to be a specialist. There are too many special fields for any\n",
      "one man, in a whole lifetime, to master a tithe of them. I must pursue\n",
      "general knowledge. When I need the work of specialists, I shall refer\n",
      "to their books.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that is not like having the knowledge yourself,” she protested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is unnecessary to have it. We profit from the work of the\n",
      "specialists. That’s what they are for. When I came in, I noticed the\n",
      "chimney-sweeps at work. They’re specialists, and when they get done,\n",
      "you will enjoy clean chimneys without knowing anything about the\n",
      "construction of chimneys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s far-fetched, I am afraid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him curiously, and he felt a reproach in her gaze and\n",
      "manner. But he was convinced of the rightness of his position.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All thinkers on general subjects, the greatest minds in the world, in\n",
      "fact, rely on the specialists. Herbert Spencer did that. He generalized\n",
      "upon the findings of thousands of investigators. He would have had to\n",
      "live a thousand lives in order to do it all himself. And so with\n",
      "Darwin. He took advantage of all that had been learned by the florists\n",
      "and cattle-breeders.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re right, Martin,” Olney said. “You know what you’re after, and\n",
      "Ruth doesn’t. She doesn’t know what she is after for herself even.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“—Oh, yes,” Olney rushed on, heading off her objection, “I know you\n",
      "call it general culture. But it doesn’t matter what you study if you\n",
      "want general culture. You can study French, or you can study German, or\n",
      "cut them both out and study Esperanto, you’ll get the culture tone just\n",
      "the same. You can study Greek or Latin, too, for the same purpose,\n",
      "though it will never be any use to you. It will be culture, though.\n",
      "Why, Ruth studied Saxon, became clever in it,—that was two years\n",
      "ago,—and all that she remembers of it now is ‘Whan that sweet Aprile\n",
      "with his schowers soote’—isn’t that the way it goes?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it’s given you the culture tone just the same,” he laughed, again\n",
      "heading her off. “I know. We were in the same classes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you speak of culture as if it should be a means to something,”\n",
      "Ruth cried out. Her eyes were flashing, and in her cheeks were two\n",
      "spots of color. “Culture is the end in itself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that is not what Martin wants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you want, Martin?” Olney demanded, turning squarely upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin felt very uncomfortable, and looked entreaty at Ruth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, what do you want?” Ruth asked. “That will settle it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, of course, I want culture,” Martin faltered. “I love beauty, and\n",
      "culture will give me a finer and keener appreciation of beauty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She nodded her head and looked triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rot, and you know it,” was Olney’s comment. “Martin’s after career,\n",
      "not culture. It just happens that culture, in his case, is incidental\n",
      "to career. If he wanted to be a chemist, culture would be unnecessary.\n",
      "Martin wants to write, but he’s afraid to say so because it will put\n",
      "you in the wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why does Martin want to write?” he went on. “Because he isn’t\n",
      "rolling in wealth. Why do you fill your head with Saxon and general\n",
      "culture? Because you don’t have to make your way in the world. Your\n",
      "father sees to that. He buys your clothes for you, and all the rest.\n",
      "What rotten good is our education, yours and mine and Arthur’s and\n",
      "Norman’s? We’re soaked in general culture, and if our daddies went\n",
      "broke to-day, we’d be falling down to-morrow on teachers’ examinations.\n",
      "The best job you could get, Ruth, would be a country school or music\n",
      "teacher in a girls’ boarding-school.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And pray what would you do?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a blessed thing. I could earn a dollar and a half a day, common\n",
      "labor, and I might get in as instructor in Hanley’s cramming joint—I\n",
      "say might, mind you, and I might be chucked out at the end of the week\n",
      "for sheer inability.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin followed the discussion closely, and while he was convinced that\n",
      "Olney was right, he resented the rather cavalier treatment he accorded\n",
      "Ruth. A new conception of love formed in his mind as he listened.\n",
      "Reason had nothing to do with love. It mattered not whether the woman\n",
      "he loved reasoned correctly or incorrectly. Love was above reason. If\n",
      "it just happened that she did not fully appreciate his necessity for a\n",
      "career, that did not make her a bit less lovable. She was all lovable,\n",
      "and what she thought had nothing to do with her lovableness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s that?” he replied to a question from Olney that broke in upon\n",
      "his train of thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was saying that I hoped you wouldn’t be fool enough to tackle\n",
      "Latin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But Latin is more than culture,” Ruth broke in. “It is equipment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, are you going to tackle it?” Olney persisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin was sore beset. He could see that Ruth was hanging eagerly upon\n",
      "his answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid I won’t have time,” he said finally. “I’d like to, but I\n",
      "won’t have time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, Martin’s not seeking culture,” Olney exulted. “He’s trying to\n",
      "get somewhere, to do something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, but it’s mental training. It’s mind discipline. It’s what makes\n",
      "disciplined minds.” Ruth looked expectantly at Martin, as if waiting\n",
      "for him to change his judgment. “You know, the foot-ball players have\n",
      "to train before the big game. And that is what Latin does for the\n",
      "thinker. It trains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rot and bosh! That’s what they told us when we were kids. But there is\n",
      "one thing they didn’t tell us then. They let us find it out for\n",
      "ourselves afterwards.” Olney paused for effect, then added, “And what\n",
      "they didn’t tell us was that every gentleman should have studied Latin,\n",
      "but that no gentleman should know Latin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now that’s unfair,” Ruth cried. “I knew you were turning the\n",
      "conversation just in order to get off something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s clever all right,” was the retort, “but it’s fair, too. The only\n",
      "men who know their Latin are the apothecaries, the lawyers, and the\n",
      "Latin professors. And if Martin wants to be one of them, I miss my\n",
      "guess. But what’s all that got to do with Herbert Spencer anyway?\n",
      "Martin’s just discovered Spencer, and he’s wild over him. Why? Because\n",
      "Spencer is taking him somewhere. Spencer couldn’t take me anywhere, nor\n",
      "you. We haven’t got anywhere to go. You’ll get married some day, and\n",
      "I’ll have nothing to do but keep track of the lawyers and business\n",
      "agents who will take care of the money my father’s going to leave me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Onley got up to go, but turned at the door and delivered a parting\n",
      "shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You leave Martin alone, Ruth. He knows what’s best for himself. Look\n",
      "at what he’s done already. He makes me sick sometimes, sick and ashamed\n",
      "of myself. He knows more now about the world, and life, and man’s\n",
      "place, and all the rest, than Arthur, or Norman, or I, or you, too, for\n",
      "that matter, and in spite of all our Latin, and French, and Saxon, and\n",
      "culture.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But Ruth is my teacher,” Martin answered chivalrously. “She is\n",
      "responsible for what little I have learned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rats!” Olney looked at Ruth, and his expression was malicious. “I\n",
      "suppose you’ll be telling me next that you read Spencer on her\n",
      "recommendation—only you didn’t. And she doesn’t know anything more\n",
      "about Darwin and evolution than I do about King Solomon’s mines. What’s\n",
      "that jawbreaker definition about something or other, of Spencer’s, that\n",
      "you sprang on us the other day—that indefinite, incoherent homogeneity\n",
      "thing? Spring it on her, and see if she understands a word of it. That\n",
      "isn’t culture, you see. Well, tra la, and if you tackle Latin, Martin,\n",
      "I won’t have any respect for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the while, interested in the discussion, Martin had been aware\n",
      "of an irk in it as well. It was about studies and lessons, dealing with\n",
      "the rudiments of knowledge, and the schoolboyish tone of it conflicted\n",
      "with the big things that were stirring in him—with the grip upon life\n",
      "that was even then crooking his fingers like eagle’s talons, with the\n",
      "cosmic thrills that made him ache, and with the inchoate consciousness\n",
      "of mastery of it all. He likened himself to a poet, wrecked on the\n",
      "shores of a strange land, filled with power of beauty, stumbling and\n",
      "stammering and vainly trying to sing in the rough, barbaric tongue of\n",
      "his brethren in the new land. And so with him. He was alive, painfully\n",
      "alive, to the great universal things, and yet he was compelled to\n",
      "potter and grope among schoolboy topics and debate whether or not he\n",
      "should study Latin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What in hell has Latin to do with it?” he demanded before his mirror\n",
      "that night. “I wish dead people would stay dead. Why should I and the\n",
      "beauty in me be ruled by the dead? Beauty is alive and everlasting.\n",
      "Languages come and go. They are the dust of the dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And his next thought was that he had been phrasing his ideas very well,\n",
      "and he went to bed wondering why he could not talk in similar fashion\n",
      "when he was with Ruth. He was only a schoolboy, with a schoolboy’s\n",
      "tongue, when he was in her presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give me time,” he said aloud. “Only give me time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Time! Time! Time! was his unending plaint.\n",

      "CHAPTER XIV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not because of Olney, but in spite of Ruth, and his love for\n",
      "Ruth, that he finally decided not to take up Latin. His money meant\n",
      "time. There was so much that was more important than Latin, so many\n",
      "studies that clamored with imperious voices. And he must write. He must\n",
      "earn money. He had had no acceptances. Twoscore of manuscripts were\n",
      "travelling the endless round of the magazines. How did the others do\n",
      "it? He spent long hours in the free reading-room, going over what\n",
      "others had written, studying their work eagerly and critically,\n",
      "comparing it with his own, and wondering, wondering, about the secret\n",
      "trick they had discovered which enabled them to sell their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was amazed at the immense amount of printed stuff that was dead. No\n",
      "light, no life, no color, was shot through it. There was no breath of\n",
      "life in it, and yet it sold, at two cents a word, twenty dollars a\n",
      "thousand—the newspaper clipping had said so. He was puzzled by\n",
      "countless short stories, written lightly and cleverly he confessed, but\n",
      "without vitality or reality. Life was so strange and wonderful, filled\n",
      "with an immensity of problems, of dreams, and of heroic toils, and yet\n",
      "these stories dealt only with the commonplaces of life. He felt the\n",
      "stress and strain of life, its fevers and sweats and wild\n",
      "insurgences—surely this was the stuff to write about! He wanted to\n",
      "glorify the leaders of forlorn hopes, the mad lovers, the giants that\n",
      "fought under stress and strain, amid terror and tragedy, making life\n",
      "crackle with the strength of their endeavor. And yet the magazine short\n",
      "stories seemed intent on glorifying the Mr. Butlers, the sordid\n",
      "dollar-chasers, and the commonplace little love affairs of commonplace\n",
      "little men and women. Was it because the editors of the magazines were\n",
      "commonplace? he demanded. Or were they afraid of life, these writers\n",
      "and editors and readers?\n",
      "\n",
      "But his chief trouble was that he did not know any editors or writers.\n",
      "And not merely did he not know any writers, but he did not know anybody\n",
      "who had ever attempted to write. There was nobody to tell him, to hint\n",
      "to him, to give him the least word of advice. He began to doubt that\n",
      "editors were real men. They seemed cogs in a machine. That was what it\n",
      "was, a machine. He poured his soul into stories, articles, and poems,\n",
      "and intrusted them to the machine. He folded them just so, put the\n",
      "proper stamps inside the long envelope along with the manuscript,\n",
      "sealed the envelope, put more stamps outside, and dropped it into the\n",
      "mail-box. It travelled across the continent, and after a certain lapse\n",
      "of time the postman returned him the manuscript in another long\n",
      "envelope, on the outside of which were the stamps he had enclosed.\n",
      "There was no human editor at the other end, but a mere cunning\n",
      "arrangement of cogs that changed the manuscript from one envelope to\n",
      "another and stuck on the stamps. It was like the slot machines wherein\n",
      "one dropped pennies, and, with a metallic whirl of machinery had\n",
      "delivered to him a stick of chewing-gum or a tablet of chocolate. It\n",
      "depended upon which slot one dropped the penny in, whether he got\n",
      "chocolate or gum. And so with the editorial machine. One slot brought\n",
      "checks and the other brought rejection slips. So far he had found only\n",
      "the latter slot.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the rejection slips that completed the horrible machinelikeness\n",
      "of the process. These slips were printed in stereotyped forms and he\n",
      "had received hundreds of them—as many as a dozen or more on each of his\n",
      "earlier manuscripts. If he had received one line, one personal line,\n",
      "along with one rejection of all his rejections, he would have been\n",
      "cheered. But not one editor had given that proof of existence. And he\n",
      "could conclude only that there were no warm human men at the other end,\n",
      "only mere cogs, well oiled and running beautifully in the machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a good fighter, whole-souled and stubborn, and he would have\n",
      "been content to continue feeding the machine for years; but he was\n",
      "bleeding to death, and not years but weeks would determine the fight.\n",
      "Each week his board bill brought him nearer destruction, while the\n",
      "postage on forty manuscripts bled him almost as severely. He no longer\n",
      "bought books, and he economized in petty ways and sought to delay the\n",
      "inevitable end; though he did not know how to economize, and brought\n",
      "the end nearer by a week when he gave his sister Marian five dollars\n",
      "for a dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "He struggled in the dark, without advice, without encouragement, and in\n",
      "the teeth of discouragement. Even Gertrude was beginning to look\n",
      "askance. At first she had tolerated with sisterly fondness what she\n",
      "conceived to be his foolishness; but now, out of sisterly solicitude,\n",
      "she grew anxious. To her it seemed that his foolishness was becoming a\n",
      "madness. Martin knew this and suffered more keenly from it than from\n",
      "the open and nagging contempt of Bernard Higginbotham. Martin had faith\n",
      "in himself, but he was alone in this faith. Not even Ruth had faith.\n",
      "She had wanted him to devote himself to study, and, though she had not\n",
      "openly disapproved of his writing, she had never approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had never offered to show her his work. A fastidious delicacy had\n",
      "prevented him. Besides, she had been studying heavily at the\n",
      "university, and he felt averse to robbing her of her time. But when she\n",
      "had taken her degree, she asked him herself to let her see something of\n",
      "what he had been doing. Martin was elated and diffident. Here was a\n",
      "judge. She was a bachelor of arts. She had studied literature under\n",
      "skilled instructors. Perhaps the editors were capable judges, too. But\n",
      "she would be different from them. She would not hand him a stereotyped\n",
      "rejection slip, nor would she inform him that lack of preference for\n",
      "his work did not necessarily imply lack of merit in his work. She would\n",
      "talk, a warm human being, in her quick, bright way, and, most important\n",
      "of all, she would catch glimpses of the real Martin Eden. In his work\n",
      "she would discern what his heart and soul were like, and she would come\n",
      "to understand something, a little something, of the stuff of his dreams\n",
      "and the strength of his power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin gathered together a number of carbon copies of his short\n",
      "stories, hesitated a moment, then added his “Sea Lyrics.” They mounted\n",
      "their wheels on a late June afternoon and rode for the hills. It was\n",
      "the second time he had been out with her alone, and as they rode along\n",
      "through the balmy warmth, just chilled by she sea-breeze to refreshing\n",
      "coolness, he was profoundly impressed by the fact that it was a very\n",
      "beautiful and well-ordered world and that it was good to be alive and\n",
      "to love. They left their wheels by the roadside and climbed to the\n",
      "brown top of an open knoll where the sunburnt grass breathed a harvest\n",
      "breath of dry sweetness and content.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Its work is done,” Martin said, as they seated themselves, she upon\n",
      "his coat, and he sprawling close to the warm earth. He sniffed the\n",
      "sweetness of the tawny grass, which entered his brain and set his\n",
      "thoughts whirling on from the particular to the universal. “It has\n",
      "achieved its reason for existence,” he went on, patting the dry grass\n",
      "affectionately. “It quickened with ambition under the dreary downpour\n",
      "of last winter, fought the violent early spring, flowered, and lured\n",
      "the insects and the bees, scattered its seeds, squared itself with its\n",
      "duty and the world, and—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you always look at things with such dreadfully practical eyes?”\n",
      "she interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I’ve been studying evolution, I guess. It’s only recently that\n",
      "I got my eyesight, if the truth were told.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it seems to me you lose sight of beauty by being so practical,\n",
      "that you destroy beauty like the boys who catch butterflies and rub the\n",
      "down off their beautiful wings.”\n",

      "He shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beauty has significance, but I never knew its significance before. I\n",
      "just accepted beauty as something meaningless, as something that was\n",

      "beauty. But now I know, or, rather, am just beginning to know. This\n",
      "grass is more beautiful to me now that I know why it is grass, and all\n",

      "time. That was going some. He saw them all, fight after fight, himself\n",
      "always whipped and Cheese-Face exulting over him. But he had never run\n",
      "away. He felt strengthened by the memory of that. He had always stayed\n",
      "and taken his medicine. Cheese-Face had been a little fiend at\n",
      "fighting, and had never once shown mercy to him. But he had stayed! He\n",
      "had stayed with it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, he saw a narrow alley, between ramshackle frame buildings. The\n",
      "end of the alley was blocked by a one-story brick building, out of\n",
      "which issued the rhythmic thunder of the presses, running off the first\n",
      "edition of the _Enquirer_. He was eleven, and Cheese-Face was thirteen,\n",
      "and they both carried the _Enquirer_. That was why they were there,\n",
      "waiting for their papers. And, of course, Cheese-Face had picked on him\n",
      "again, and there was another fight that was indeterminate, because at\n",
      "quarter to four the door of the press-room was thrown open and the gang\n",
      "of boys crowded in to fold their papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll lick you to-morrow,” he heard Cheese-Face promise; and he heard\n",
      "his own voice, piping and trembling with unshed tears, agreeing to be\n",
      "there on the morrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he had come there the next day, hurrying from school to be there\n",
      "first, and beating Cheese-Face by two minutes. The other boys said he\n",
      "was all right, and gave him advice, pointing out his faults as a\n",
      "scrapper and promising him victory if he carried out their\n",
      "instructions. The same boys gave Cheese-Face advice, too. How they had\n",
      "enjoyed the fight! He paused in his recollections long enough to envy\n",
      "them the spectacle he and Cheese-Face had put up. Then the fight was\n",
      "on, and it went on, without rounds, for thirty minutes, until the\n",
      "press-room door was opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "He watched the youthful apparition of himself, day after day, hurrying\n",
      "from school to the _Enquirer_ alley. He could not walk very fast. He\n",
      "was stiff and lame from the incessant fighting. His forearms were black\n",
      "and blue from wrist to elbow, what of the countless blows he had warded\n",
      "off, and here and there the tortured flesh was beginning to fester. His\n",
      "head and arms and shoulders ached, the small of his back ached,—he\n",
      "ached all over, and his brain was heavy and dazed. He did not play at\n",
      "school. Nor did he study. Even to sit still all day at his desk, as he\n",
      "did, was a torment. It seemed centuries since he had begun the round of\n",
      "daily fights, and time stretched away into a nightmare and infinite\n",
      "future of daily fights. Why couldn’t Cheese-Face be licked? he often\n",
      "thought; that would put him, Martin, out of his misery. It never\n",
      "entered his head to cease fighting, to allow Cheese-Face to whip him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so he dragged himself to the _Enquirer_ alley, sick in body and\n",
      "soul, but learning the long patience, to confront his eternal enemy,\n",
      "Cheese-Face, who was just as sick as he, and just a bit willing to quit\n",
      "if it were not for the gang of newsboys that looked on and made pride\n",
      "painful and necessary. One afternoon, after twenty minutes of desperate\n",
      "efforts to annihilate each other according to set rules that did not\n",
      "permit kicking, striking below the belt, nor hitting when one was down,\n",
      "Cheese-Face, panting for breath and reeling, offered to call it quits.\n",
      "And Martin, head on arms, thrilled at the picture he caught of himself,\n",
      "at that moment in the afternoon of long ago, when he reeled and panted\n",
      "and choked with the blood that ran into his mouth and down his throat\n",
      "from his cut lips; when he tottered toward Cheese-Face, spitting out a\n",
      "mouthful of blood so that he could speak, crying out that he would\n",
      "never quit, though Cheese-Face could give in if he wanted to. And\n",
      "Cheese-Face did not give in, and the fight went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day and the next, days without end, witnessed the afternoon\n",
      "fight. When he put up his arms, each day, to begin, they pained\n",
      "exquisitely, and the first few blows, struck and received, racked his\n",
      "soul; after that things grew numb, and he fought on blindly, seeing as\n",
      "in a dream, dancing and wavering, the large features and burning,\n",
      "animal-like eyes of Cheese-Face. He concentrated upon that face; all\n",
      "else about him was a whirling void. There was nothing else in the world\n",
      "but that face, and he would never know rest, blessed rest, until he had\n",
      "beaten that face into a pulp with his bleeding knuckles, or until the\n",
      "bleeding knuckles that somehow belonged to that face had beaten him\n",
      "into a pulp. And then, one way or the other, he would have rest. But to\n",
      "quit,—for him, Martin, to quit,—that was impossible!\n",
      "\n",
      "Came the day when he dragged himself into the _Enquirer_ alley, and\n",
      "there was no Cheese-Face. Nor did Cheese-Face come. The boys\n",
      "congratulated him, and told him that he had licked Cheese-Face. But\n",
      "Martin was not satisfied. He had not licked Cheese-Face, nor had\n",
      "Cheese-Face licked him. The problem had not been solved. It was not\n",
      "until afterward that they learned that Cheese-Face’s father had died\n",
      "suddenly that very day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin skipped on through the years to the night in the nigger heaven\n",
      "at the Auditorium. He was seventeen and just back from sea. A row\n",
      "started. Somebody was bullying somebody, and Martin interfered, to be\n",
      "confronted by Cheese-Face’s blazing eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll fix you after de show,” his ancient enemy hissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin nodded. The nigger-heaven bouncer was making his way toward the\n",
      "disturbance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll meet you outside, after the last act,” Martin whispered, the\n",
      "while his face showed undivided interest in the buck-and-wing dancing\n",
      "on the stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bouncer glared and went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Got a gang?” he asked Cheese-Face, at the end of the act.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I got to get one,” Martin announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the acts he mustered his following—three fellows he knew from\n",
      "the nail works, a railroad fireman, and half a dozen of the Boo Gang,\n",
      "along with as many more from the dread Eighteen-and-Market Gang.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the theatre let out, the two gangs strung along inconspicuously on\n",
      "opposite sides of the street. When they came to a quiet corner, they\n",
      "united and held a council of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eighth Street Bridge is the place,” said a red-headed fellow belonging\n",
      "to Cheese-Face’s Gang. “You kin fight in the middle, under the electric\n",
      "light, an’ whichever way the bulls come in we kin sneak the other way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s agreeable to me,” Martin said, after consulting with the\n",
      "leaders of his own gang.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Eighth Street Bridge, crossing an arm of San Antonio Estuary, was\n",
      "the length of three city blocks. In the middle of the bridge, and at\n",
      "each end, were electric lights. No policeman could pass those\n",
      "end-lights unseen. It was the safe place for the battle that revived\n",
      "itself under Martin’s eyelids. He saw the two gangs, aggressive and\n",
      "sullen, rigidly keeping apart from each other and backing their\n",
      "respective champions; and he saw himself and Cheese-Face stripping. A\n",
      "short distance away lookouts were set, their task being to watch the\n",
      "lighted ends of the bridge. A member of the Boo Gang held Martin’s\n",
      "coat, and shirt, and cap, ready to race with them into safety in case\n",
      "the police interfered. Martin watched himself go into the centre,\n",
      "facing Cheese-Face, and he heard himself say, as he held up his hand\n",
      "warningly:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“They ain’t no hand-shakin’ in this. Understand? They ain’t nothin’ but\n",
      "scrap. No throwin’ up the sponge. This is a grudge-fight an’ it’s to a\n",
      "finish. Understand? Somebody’s goin’ to get licked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheese-Face wanted to demur,—Martin could see that,—but Cheese-Face’s\n",
      "old perilous pride was touched before the two gangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, come on,” he replied. “Wot’s the good of chewin’ de rag about it?\n",
      "I’m wit’ cheh to de finish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they fell upon each other, like young bulls, in all the glory of\n",
      "youth, with naked fists, with hatred, with desire to hurt, to maim, to\n",
      "destroy. All the painful, thousand years’ gains of man in his upward\n",
      "climb through creation were lost. Only the electric light remained, a\n",
      "milestone on the path of the great human adventure. Martin and\n",
      "Cheese-Face were two savages, of the stone age, of the squatting place\n",
      "and the tree refuge. They sank lower and lower into the muddy abyss,\n",
      "back into the dregs of the raw beginnings of life, striving blindly and\n",
      "chemically, as atoms strive, as the star-dust of the heavens strives,\n",
      "colliding, recoiling, and colliding again and eternally again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“God! We are animals! Brute-beasts!” Martin muttered aloud, as he\n",
      "watched the progress of the fight. It was to him, with his splendid\n",
      "power of vision, like gazing into a kinetoscope. He was both onlooker\n",
      "and participant. His long months of culture and refinement shuddered at\n",
      "the sight; then the present was blotted out of his consciousness and\n",
      "the ghosts of the past possessed him, and he was Martin Eden, just\n",
      "returned from sea and fighting Cheese-Face on the Eighth Street Bridge.\n",
      "He suffered and toiled and sweated and bled, and exulted when his naked\n",
      "knuckles smashed home.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were twin whirlwinds of hatred, revolving about each other\n",
      "monstrously. The time passed, and the two hostile gangs became very\n",
      "quiet. They had never witnessed such intensity of ferocity, and they\n",
      "were awed by it. The two fighters were greater brutes than they. The\n",
      "first splendid velvet edge of youth and condition wore off, and they\n",
      "fought more cautiously and deliberately. There had been no advantage\n",
      "gained either way. “It’s anybody’s fight,” Martin heard some one\n",
      "saying. Then he followed up a feint, right and left, was fiercely\n",
      "countered, and felt his cheek laid open to the bone. No bare knuckle\n",
      "had done that. He heard mutters of amazement at the ghastly damage\n",
      "wrought, and was drenched with his own blood. But he gave no sign. He\n",
      "became immensely wary, for he was wise with knowledge of the low\n",
      "cunning and foul vileness of his kind. He watched and waited, until he\n",
      "feigned a wild rush, which he stopped midway, for he had seen the glint\n",
      "of metal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold up yer hand!” he screamed. “Them’s brass knuckles, an’ you hit me\n",
      "with ’em!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both gangs surged forward, growling and snarling. In a second there\n",
      "would be a free-for-all fight, and he would be robbed of his vengeance.\n",
      "He was beside himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You guys keep out!” he screamed hoarsely. “Understand? Say, d’ye\n",
      "understand?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They shrank away from him. They were brutes, but he was the arch-brute,\n",
      "a thing of terror that towered over them and dominated them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is my scrap, an’ they ain’t goin’ to be no buttin’ in. Gimme them\n",
      "knuckles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheese-Face, sobered and a bit frightened, surrendered the foul weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You passed ’em to him, you red-head sneakin’ in behind the push\n",
      "there,” Martin went on, as he tossed the knuckles into the water. “I\n",
      "seen you, an’ I was wonderin’ what you was up to. If you try anything\n",
      "like that again, I’ll beat cheh to death. Understand?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They fought on, through exhaustion and beyond, to exhaustion\n",
      "immeasurable and inconceivable, until the crowd of brutes, its\n",
      "blood-lust sated, terrified by what it saw, begged them impartially to\n",
      "cease. And Cheese-Face, ready to drop and die, or to stay on his legs\n",
      "and die, a grisly monster out of whose features all likeness to\n",
      "Cheese-Face had been beaten, wavered and hesitated; but Martin sprang\n",
      "in and smashed him again and again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, after a seeming century or so, with Cheese-Face weakening fast,\n",
      "in a mix-up of blows there was a loud snap, and Martin’s right arm\n",
      "dropped to his side. It was a broken bone. Everybody heard it and knew;\n",
      "and Cheese-Face knew, rushing like a tiger in the other’s extremity and\n",
      "raining blow on blow. Martin’s gang surged forward to interfere. Dazed\n",
      "by the rapid succession of blows, Martin warned them back with vile and\n",
      "earnest curses sobbed out and groaned in ultimate desolation and\n",
      "despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "He punched on, with his left hand only, and as he punched, doggedly,\n",
      "only half-conscious, as from a remote distance he heard murmurs of fear\n",
      "in the gangs, and one who said with shaking voice: “This ain’t a scrap,\n",
      "fellows. It’s murder, an’ we ought to stop it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But no one stopped it, and he was glad, punching on wearily and\n",
      "endlessly with his one arm, battering away at a bloody something before\n",
      "him that was not a face but a horror, an oscillating, hideous,\n",
      "gibbering, nameless thing that persisted before his wavering vision and\n",
      "would not go away. And he punched on and on, slower and slower, as the\n",
      "last shreds of vitality oozed from him, through centuries and aeons and\n",
      "enormous lapses of time, until, in a dim way, he became aware that the\n",
      "nameless thing was sinking, slowly sinking down to the rough\n",
      "board-planking of the bridge. And the next moment he was standing over\n",
      "it, staggering and swaying on shaky legs, clutching at the air for\n",
      "support, and saying in a voice he did not recognize:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“D’ye want any more? Say, d’ye want any more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was still saying it, over and over,—demanding, entreating,\n",
      "threatening, to know if it wanted any more,—when he felt the fellows of\n",
      "his gang laying hands on him, patting him on the back and trying to put\n",
      "his coat on him. And then came a sudden rush of blackness and oblivion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tin alarm-clock on the table ticked on, but Martin Eden, his face\n",
      "buried on his arms, did not hear it. He heard nothing. He did not\n",
      "think. So absolutely had he relived life that he had fainted just as he\n",
      "fainted years before on the Eighth Street Bridge. For a full minute the\n",
      "blackness and the blankness endured. Then, like one from the dead, he\n",
      "sprang upright, eyes flaming, sweat pouring down his face, shouting:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“I licked you, Cheese-Face! It took me eleven years, but I licked you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "His knees were trembling under him, he felt faint, and he staggered\n",
      "back to the bed, sinking down and sitting on the edge of it. He was\n",
      "still in the clutch of the past. He looked about the room, perplexed,\n",
      "alarmed, wondering where he was, until he caught sight of the pile of\n",
      "manuscripts in the corner. Then the wheels of memory slipped ahead\n",
      "through four years of time, and he was aware of the present, of the\n",
      "books he had opened and the universe he had won from their pages, of\n",
      "his dreams and ambitions, and of his love for a pale wraith of a girl,\n",
      "sensitive and sheltered and ethereal, who would die of horror did she\n",
      "witness but one moment of what he had just lived through—one moment of\n",
      "all the muck of life through which he had waded.\n",
      "\n",
      "He arose to his feet and confronted himself in the looking-glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so you arise from the mud, Martin Eden,” he said solemnly. “And\n",
      "you cleanse your eyes in a great brightness, and thrust your shoulders\n",
      "among the stars, doing what all life has done, letting the ‘ape and\n",
      "tiger die’ and wresting highest heritage from all powers that be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked more closely at himself and laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A bit of hysteria and melodrama, eh?” he queried. “Well, never mind.\n",

      "The alarm-clock went off, jerking Martin out of sleep with a suddenness\n",
      "that would have given headache to one with less splendid constitution.\n",
      "Though he slept soundly, he awoke instantly, like a cat, and he awoke\n",
      "eagerly, glad that the five hours of unconsciousness were gone. He\n",
      "hated the oblivion of sleep. There was too much to do, too much of life\n",
      "to live. He grudged every moment of life sleep robbed him of, and\n",
      "before the clock had ceased its clattering he was head and ears in the\n",
      "washbasin and thrilling to the cold bite of the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he did not follow his regular programme. There was no unfinished\n",
      "story waiting his hand, no new story demanding articulation. He had\n",
      "studied late, and it was nearly time for breakfast. He tried to read a\n",
      "chapter in Fiske, but his brain was restless and he closed the book.\n",
      "To-day witnessed the beginning of the new battle, wherein for some time\n",
      "there would be no writing. He was aware of a sadness akin to that with\n",
      "which one leaves home and family. He looked at the manuscripts in the\n",
      "corner. That was it. He was going away from them, his pitiful,\n",
      "dishonored children that were welcome nowhere. He went over and began\n",
      "to rummage among them, reading snatches here and there, his favorite\n",
      "portions. “The Pot” he honored with reading aloud, as he did\n",
      "“Adventure.” “Joy,” his latest-born, completed the day before and\n",
      "tossed into the corner for lack of stamps, won his keenest approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t understand,” he murmured. “Or maybe it’s the editors who can’t\n",

      "straighten up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He crossed on the ferry to San Francisco and made his way to an\n",

      "was interrupted by a new-comer, dressed rather foppishly, as some\n",

      "“Too much for me.” Martin caught an amusing glimpse of himself ironing\n",

      "\n",
      "“But work like hell,” the other added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin caressed his swelling shoulder-muscles significantly. “That came\n",
      "from hard work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then let’s get to it.” Joe held his hand to his head for a moment.\n",
      "“Gee, but it’s a stem-winder. Can hardly see. I went down the line last\n",
      "night—everything—everything. Here’s the frame-up. The wages for two is\n",
      "a hundred and board. I’ve ben drawin’ down sixty, the second man forty.\n",
      "But he knew the biz. You’re green. If I break you in, I’ll be doing\n",
      "plenty of your work at first. Suppose you begin at thirty, an’ work up\n",
      "to the forty. I’ll play fair. Just as soon as you can do your share you\n",
      "get the forty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll go you,” Martin announced, stretching out his hand, which the\n",
      "other shook. “Any advance?—for rail-road ticket and extras?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I blew it in,” was Joe’s sad answer, with another reach at his aching\n",
      "head. “All I got is a return ticket.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I’m broke—when I pay my board.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jump it,” Joe advised.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t. Owe it to my sister.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe whistled a long, perplexed whistle, and racked his brains to little\n",
      "purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve got the price of the drinks,” he said desperately. “Come on, an’\n",
      "mebbe we’ll cook up something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin declined.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Water-wagon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This time Martin nodded, and Joe lamented, “Wish I was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I somehow just can’t,” he said in extenuation. “After I’ve ben\n",
      "workin’ like hell all week I just got to booze up. If I didn’t, I’d cut\n",
      "my throat or burn up the premises. But I’m glad you’re on the wagon.\n",
      "Stay with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin knew of the enormous gulf between him and this man—the gulf the\n",
      "books had made; but he found no difficulty in crossing back over that\n",
      "gulf. He had lived all his life in the working-class world, and the\n",
      "_camaraderie_ of labor was second nature with him. He solved the\n",
      "difficulty of transportation that was too much for the other’s aching\n",
      "head. He would send his trunk up to Shelly Hot Springs on Joe’s ticket.\n",
      "As for himself, there was his wheel. It was seventy miles, and he could\n",
      "ride it on Sunday and be ready for work Monday morning. In the meantime\n",
      "he would go home and pack up. There was no one to say good-by to. Ruth\n",
      "and her whole family were spending the long summer in the Sierras, at\n",
      "Lake Tahoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "He arrived at Shelly Hot Springs, tired and dusty, on Sunday night. Joe\n",
      "greeted him exuberantly. With a wet towel bound about his aching brow,\n",
      "he had been at work all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Part of last week’s washin’ mounted up, me bein’ away to get you,” he\n",
      "explained. “Your box arrived all right. It’s in your room. But it’s a\n",
      "hell of a thing to call a trunk. An’ what’s in it? Gold bricks?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe sat on the bed while Martin unpacked. The box was a packing-case\n",
      "for breakfast food, and Mr. Higginbotham had charged him half a dollar\n",
      "for it. Two rope handles, nailed on by Martin, had technically\n",
      "transformed it into a trunk eligible for the baggage-car. Joe watched,\n",
      "with bulging eyes, a few shirts and several changes of underclothes\n",
      "come out of the box, followed by books, and more books.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Books clean to the bottom?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin nodded, and went on arranging the books on a kitchen table which\n",
      "served in the room in place of a wash-stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gee!” Joe exploded, then waited in silence for the deduction to arise\n",
      "in his brain. At last it came.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, you don’t care for the girls—much?” he queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” was the answer. “I used to chase a lot before I tackled the\n",
      "books. But since then there’s no time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And there won’t be any time here. All you can do is work an’ sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin thought of his five hours’ sleep a night, and smiled. The room\n",
      "was situated over the laundry and was in the same building with the\n",
      "engine that pumped water, made electricity, and ran the laundry\n",
      "machinery. The engineer, who occupied the adjoining room, dropped in to\n",
      "meet the new hand and helped Martin rig up an electric bulb, on an\n",
      "extension wire, so that it travelled along a stretched cord from over\n",
      "the table to the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, at quarter-past six, Martin was routed out for a\n",
      "quarter-to-seven breakfast. There happened to be a bath-tub for the\n",
      "servants in the laundry building, and he electrified Joe by taking a\n",
      "cold bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gee, but you’re a hummer!” Joe announced, as they sat down to\n",
      "breakfast in a corner of the hotel kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "With them was the engineer, the gardener, and the assistant gardener,\n",
      "and two or three men from the stable. They ate hurriedly and gloomily,\n",
      "with but little conversation, and as Martin ate and listened he\n",
      "realized how far he had travelled from their status. Their small mental\n",
      "caliber was depressing to him, and he was anxious to get away from\n",
      "them. So he bolted his breakfast, a sickly, sloppy affair, as rapidly\n",
      "as they, and heaved a sigh of relief when he passed out through the\n",
      "kitchen door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a perfectly appointed, small steam laundry, wherein the most\n",
      "modern machinery did everything that was possible for machinery to do.\n",
      "Martin, after a few instructions, sorted the great heaps of soiled\n",
      "clothes, while Joe started the masher and made up fresh supplies of\n",
      "soft-soap, compounded of biting chemicals that compelled him to swathe\n",
      "his mouth and nostrils and eyes in bath-towels till he resembled a\n",
      "mummy. Finished the sorting, Martin lent a hand in wringing the\n",
      "clothes. This was done by dumping them into a spinning receptacle that\n",
      "went at a rate of a few thousand revolutions a minute, tearing the\n",
      "water from the clothes by centrifugal force. Then Martin began to\n",
      "alternate between the dryer and the wringer, between times “shaking\n",
      "out” socks and stockings. By the afternoon, one feeding and one\n",
      "stacking up, they were running socks and stockings through the mangle\n",
      "while the irons were heating. Then it was hot irons and underclothes\n",
      "till six o’clock, at which time Joe shook his head dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Way behind,” he said. “Got to work after supper.” And after supper\n",
      "they worked until ten o’clock, under the blazing electric lights, until\n",
      "the last piece of under-clothing was ironed and folded away in the\n",
      "distributing room. It was a hot California night, and though the\n",
      "windows were thrown wide, the room, with its red-hot ironing-stove, was\n",
      "a furnace. Martin and Joe, down to undershirts, bare armed, sweated and\n",
      "panted for air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Like trimming cargo in the tropics,” Martin said, when they went\n",
      "upstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll do,” Joe answered. “You take hold like a good fellow. If you\n",
      "keep up the pace, you’ll be on thirty dollars only one month. The\n",
      "second month you’ll be gettin’ your forty. But don’t tell me you never\n",
      "ironed before. I know better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never ironed a rag in my life, honestly, until to-day,” Martin\n",
      "protested.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was surprised at his weariness when he got into his room, forgetful\n",
      "of the fact that he had been on his feet and working without let up for\n",
      "fourteen hours. He set the alarm clock at six, and measured back five\n",
      "hours to one o’clock. He could read until then. Slipping off his shoes,\n",
      "to ease his swollen feet, he sat down at the table with his books. He\n",
      "opened Fiske, where he had left off to read. But he found trouble and\n",
      "began to read it through a second time. Then he awoke, in pain from his\n",
      "stiffened muscles and chilled by the mountain wind that had begun to\n",
      "blow in through the window. He looked at the clock. It marked two. He\n",
      "had been asleep four hours. He pulled off his clothes and crawled into\n",
      "bed, where he was asleep the moment after his head touched the pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuesday was a day of similar unremitting toil. The speed with which Joe\n",
      "worked won Martin’s admiration. Joe was a dozen of demons for work. He\n",
      "was keyed up to concert pitch, and there was never a moment in the long\n",
      "day when he was not fighting for moments. He concentrated himself upon\n",
      "his work and upon how to save time, pointing out to Martin where he did\n",
      "in five motions what could be done in three, or in three motions what\n",
      "could be done in two. “Elimination of waste motion,” Martin phrased it\n",
      "as he watched and patterned after. He was a good workman himself, quick\n",
      "and deft, and it had always been a point of pride with him that no man\n",
      "should do any of his work for him or outwork him. As a result, he\n",
      "concentrated with a similar singleness of purpose, greedily snapping up\n",
      "the hints and suggestions thrown out by his working mate. He “rubbed\n",
      "out” collars and cuffs, rubbing the starch out from between the double\n",
      "thicknesses of linen so that there would be no blisters when it came to\n",
      "the ironing, and doing it at a pace that elicited Joe’s praise.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was never an interval when something was not at hand to be done.\n",
      "Joe waited for nothing, waited on nothing, and went on the jump from\n",
      "task to task. They starched two hundred white shirts, with a single\n",
      "gathering movement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands, neckband,\n",
      "yoke, and bosom protruded beyond the circling right hand. At the same\n",
      "moment the left hand held up the body of the shirt so that it would not\n",
      "enter the starch, and at the same moment the right hand dipped into the\n",
      "starch—starch so hot that, in order to wring it out, their hands had to\n",
      "thrust, and thrust continually, into a bucket of cold water. And that\n",
      "night they worked till half-past ten, dipping “fancy starch”—all the\n",
      "frilled and airy, delicate wear of ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me for the tropics and no clothes,” Martin laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And me out of a job,” Joe answered seriously. “I don’t know nothin’\n",
      "but laundrying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you know it well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ought to. Began in the Contra Costa in Oakland when I was eleven,\n",
      "shakin’ out for the mangle. That was eighteen years ago, an’ I’ve never\n",
      "done a tap of anything else. But this job is the fiercest I ever had.\n",
      "Ought to be one more man on it at least. We work to-morrow night.\n",
      "Always run the mangle Wednesday nights—collars an’ cuffs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin set his alarm, drew up to the table, and opened Fiske. He did\n",
      "not finish the first paragraph. The lines blurred and ran together and\n",
      "his head nodded. He walked up and down, batting his head savagely with\n",
      "his fists, but he could not conquer the numbness of sleep. He propped\n",
      "the book before him, and propped his eyelids with his fingers, and fell\n",
      "asleep with his eyes wide open. Then he surrendered, and, scarcely\n",
      "conscious of what he did, got off his clothes and into bed. He slept\n",
      "seven hours of heavy, animal-like sleep, and awoke by the alarm,\n",
      "feeling that he had not had enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doin’ much readin’?” Joe asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind. We got to run the mangle to-night, but Thursday we’ll\n",
      "knock off at six. That’ll give you a chance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin washed woollens that day, by hand, in a large barrel, with\n",
      "strong soft-soap, by means of a hub from a wagon wheel, mounted on a\n",
      "plunger-pole that was attached to a spring-pole overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My invention,” Joe said proudly. “Beats a washboard an’ your knuckles,\n",
      "and, besides, it saves at least fifteen minutes in the week, an’\n",
      "fifteen minutes ain’t to be sneezed at in this shebang.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Running the collars and cuffs through the mangle was also Joe’s idea.\n",
      "That night, while they toiled on under the electric lights, he\n",
      "explained it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Something no laundry ever does, except this one. An’ I got to do it if\n",
      "I’m goin’ to get done Saturday afternoon at three o’clock. But I know\n",
      "how, an’ that’s the difference. Got to have right heat, right pressure,\n",
      "and run ’em through three times. Look at that!” He held a cuff aloft.\n",
      "“Couldn’t do it better by hand or on a tiler.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thursday, Joe was in a rage. A bundle of extra “fancy starch” had come\n",
      "in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m goin’ to quit,” he announced. “I won’t stand for it. I’m goin’ to\n",
      "quit it cold. What’s the good of me workin’ like a slave all week,\n",
      "a-savin’ minutes, an’ them a-comin’ an’ ringin’ in fancy-starch extras\n",
      "on me? This is a free country, an’ I’m to tell that fat Dutchman what I\n",
      "think of him. An’ I won’t tell ’m in French. Plain United States is\n",
      "good enough for me. Him a-ringin’ in fancy starch extras!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We got to work to-night,” he said the next moment, reversing his\n",
      "judgment and surrendering to fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Martin did no reading that night. He had seen no daily paper all\n",
      "week, and, strangely to him, felt no desire to see one. He was not\n",
      "interested in the news. He was too tired and jaded to be interested in\n",
      "anything, though he planned to leave Saturday afternoon, if they\n",
      "finished at three, and ride on his wheel to Oakland. It was seventy\n",
      "miles, and the same distance back on Sunday afternoon would leave him\n",
      "anything but rested for the second week’s work. It would have been\n",
      "easier to go on the train, but the round trip was two dollars and a\n",
      "half, and he was intent on saving money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER XVII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin learned to do many things. In the course of the first week, in\n",
      "one afternoon, he and Joe accounted for the two hundred white shirts.\n",
      "Joe ran the tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel\n",
      "string which furnished the pressure. By this means he ironed the yoke,\n",
      "wristbands, and neckband, setting the latter at right angles to the\n",
      "shirt, and put the glossy finish on the bosom. As fast as he finished\n",
      "them, he flung the shirts on a rack between him and Martin, who caught\n",
      "them up and “backed” them. This task consisted of ironing all the\n",
      "unstarched portions of the shirts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was exhausting work, carried on, hour after hour, at top speed. Out\n",
      "on the broad verandas of the hotel, men and women, in cool white,\n",
      "sipped iced drinks and kept their circulation down. But in the laundry\n",
      "the air was sizzling. The huge stove roared red hot and white hot,\n",
      "while the irons, moving over the damp cloth, sent up clouds of steam.\n",
      "The heat of these irons was different from that used by housewives. An\n",
      "iron that stood the ordinary test of a wet finger was too cold for Joe\n",
      "and Martin, and such test was useless. They went wholly by holding the\n",
      "irons close to their cheeks, gauging the heat by some secret mental\n",
      "process that Martin admired but could not understand. When the fresh\n",
      "irons proved too hot, they hooked them on iron rods and dipped them\n",
      "into cold water. This again required a precise and subtle judgment. A\n",
      "fraction of a second too long in the water and the fine and silken edge\n",
      "of the proper heat was lost, and Martin found time to marvel at the\n",
      "accuracy he developed—an automatic accuracy, founded upon criteria that\n",
      "were machine-like and unerring.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was little time in which to marvel. All Martin’s\n",
      "consciousness was concentrated in the work. Ceaselessly active, head\n",
      "and hand, an intelligent machine, all that constituted him a man was\n",
      "devoted to furnishing that intelligence. There was no room in his brain\n",
      "for the universe and its mighty problems. All the broad and spacious\n",
      "corridors of his mind were closed and hermetically sealed. The echoing\n",
      "chamber of his soul was a narrow room, a conning tower, whence were\n",
      "directed his arm and shoulder muscles, his ten nimble fingers, and the\n",
      "swift-moving iron along its steaming path in broad, sweeping strokes,\n",
      "just so many strokes and no more, just so far with each stroke and not\n",
      "a fraction of an inch farther, rushing along interminable sleeves,\n",
      "sides, backs, and tails, and tossing the finished shirts, without\n",
      "rumpling, upon the receiving frame. And even as his hurrying soul\n",
      "tossed, it was reaching for another shirt. This went on, hour after\n",
      "hour, while outside all the world swooned under the overhead California\n",
      "sun. But there was no swooning in that superheated room. The cool\n",
      "guests on the verandas needed clean linen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sweat poured from Martin. He drank enormous quantities of water,\n",
      "but so great was the heat of the day and of his exertions, that the\n",
      "water sluiced through the interstices of his flesh and out at all his\n",
      "pores. Always, at sea, except at rare intervals, the work he performed\n",
      "had given him ample opportunity to commune with himself. The master of\n",
      "the ship had been lord of Martin’s time; but here the manager of the\n",
      "hotel was lord of Martin’s thoughts as well. He had no thoughts save\n",
      "for the nerve-racking, body-destroying toil. Outside of that it was\n",
      "impossible to think. He did not know that he loved Ruth. She did not\n",
      "even exist, for his driven soul had no time to remember her. It was\n",
      "only when he crawled to bed at night, or to breakfast in the morning,\n",
      "that she asserted herself to him in fleeting memories.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is hell, ain’t it?” Joe remarked once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin nodded, but felt a rasp of irritation. The statement had been\n",
      "obvious and unnecessary. They did not talk while they worked.\n",
      "Conversation threw them out of their stride, as it did this time,\n",
      "compelling Martin to miss a stroke of his iron and to make two extra\n",
      "motions before he caught his stride again.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday morning the washer ran. Twice a week they had to put through\n",
      "hotel linen,—the sheets, pillow-slips, spreads, table-cloths, and\n",
      "napkins. This finished, they buckled down to “fancy starch.” It was\n",
      "slow work, fastidious and delicate, and Martin did not learn it so\n",
      "readily. Besides, he could not take chances. Mistakes were disastrous.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See that,” Joe said, holding up a filmy corset-cover that he could\n",
      "have crumpled from view in one hand. “Scorch that an’ it’s twenty\n",
      "dollars out of your wages.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Martin did not scorch that, and eased down on his muscular tension,\n",
      "though nervous tension rose higher than ever, and he listened\n",
      "sympathetically to the other’s blasphemies as he toiled and suffered\n",
      "over the beautiful things that women wear when they do not have to do\n",
      "their own laundrying. “Fancy starch” was Martin’s nightmare, and it was\n",
      "Joe’s, too. It was “fancy starch” that robbed them of their hard-won\n",
      "minutes. They toiled at it all day. At seven in the evening they broke\n",
      "off to run the hotel linen through the mangle. At ten o’clock, while\n",
      "the hotel guests slept, the two laundrymen sweated on at “fancy starch”\n",
      "till midnight, till one, till two. At half-past two they knocked off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday morning it was “fancy starch,” and odds and ends, and at three\n",
      "in the afternoon the week’s work was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ain’t a-goin’ to ride them seventy miles into Oakland on top of\n",
      "this?” Joe demanded, as they sat on the stairs and took a triumphant\n",
      "smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Got to,” was the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you goin’ for?—a girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; to save two and a half on the railroad ticket. I want to renew\n",
      "some books at the library.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t you send ’em down an’ up by express? That’ll cost only a\n",

      "He looked it. Indomitable, never resting, fighting for seconds and\n",
      "minutes all week, circumventing delays and crushing down obstacles, a\n",
      "fount of resistless energy, a high-driven human motor, a demon for\n",
      "work, now that he had accomplished the week’s task he was in a state of\n",
      "collapse. He was worn and haggard, and his handsome face drooped in\n",
      "lean exhaustion. He pulled his cigarette spiritlessly, and his voice\n",

      "a long journey to him. He lay on his bed with his shoes off, trying to\n",
      "make up his mind. He did not reach out for a book. He was too tired to\n",
      "feel sleepy, and he lay, scarcely thinking, in a semi-stupor of\n",

      "was ripping the slats off the bar, Martin understood. He went to bed\n",
      "immediately afterward, and in the morning decided that he was greatly\n",
      "rested. Joe being still absent, Martin procured a Sunday paper and lay\n",
      "down in a shady nook under the trees. The morning passed, he knew not\n",
      "how. He did not sleep, nobody disturbed him, and he did not finish the\n",
      "paper. He came back to it in the afternoon, after dinner, and fell\n",
      "asleep over it.\n",

      "So passed Sunday, and Monday morning he was hard at work, sorting\n",

      "lights each night and that culminated on Saturday afternoon at three\n",

      "down to the village to forget. Martin’s Sunday was the same as before.\n",
      "He slept in the shade of the trees, toiled aimlessly through the\n",
      "newspaper, and spent long hours lying on his back, doing nothing,\n",
      "thinking nothing. He was too dazed to think, though he was aware that\n",
      "he did not like himself. He was self-repelled, as though he had\n",
      "undergone some degradation or was intrinsically foul. All that was\n",
      "god-like in him was blotted out. The spur of ambition was blunted; he\n",
      "had no vitality with which to feel the prod of it. He was dead. His\n",
      "soul seemed dead. He was a beast, a work-beast. He saw no beauty in the\n",
      "sunshine sifting down through the green leaves, nor did the azure vault\n",
      "of the sky whisper as of old and hint of cosmic vastness and secrets\n",
      "trembling to disclosure. Life was intolerably dull and stupid, and its\n",
      "taste was bad in his mouth. A black screen was drawn across his mirror\n",
      "of inner vision, and fancy lay in a darkened sick-room where entered no\n",
      "ray of light. He envied Joe, down in the village, rampant, tearing the\n",
      "slats off the bar, his brain gnawing with maggots, exulting in maudlin\n",
      "ways over maudlin things, fantastically and gloriously drunk and\n",

      "refusing his stuff. He could see that clearly now, and laugh at himself\n",
      "and the dreams he had dreamed. Ruth returned his “Sea Lyrics” by mail.\n",
      "He read her letter apathetically. She did her best to say how much she\n",
      "liked them and that they were beautiful. But she could not lie, and she\n",
      "could not disguise the truth from herself. She knew they were failures,\n",
      "and he read her disapproval in every perfunctory and unenthusiastic\n",
      "line of her letter. And she was right. He was firmly convinced of it as\n",
      "he read the poems over. Beauty and wonder had departed from him, and as\n",
      "he read the poems he caught himself puzzling as to what he had had in\n",
      "mind when he wrote them. His audacities of phrase struck him as\n",
      "grotesque, his felicities of expression were monstrosities, and\n",
      "everything was absurd, unreal, and impossible. He would have burned the\n",
      "“Sea Lyrics” on the spot, had his will been strong enough to set them\n",
      "aflame. There was the engine-room, but the exertion of carrying them to\n",
      "the furnace was not worth while. All his exertion was used in washing\n",
      "other persons’ clothes. He did not have any left for private affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He resolved that when Sunday came he would pull himself together and\n",
      "answer Ruth’s letter. But Saturday afternoon, after work was finished\n",
      "and he had taken a bath, the desire to forget overpowered him. “I guess\n",
      "I’ll go down and see how Joe’s getting on,” was the way he put it to\n",
      "himself; and in the same moment he knew that he lied. But he did not\n",
      "have the energy to consider the lie. If he had had the energy, he would\n",
      "have refused to consider the lie, because he wanted to forget. He\n",

      "his own glass brimming before he passed the bottle.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The other was dawdling with the bottle, and Martin refused to wait for\n",

      "\n",
      "“Now, I can wait for you,” he said grimly; “but hurry up.”\n",

      "“The work did it, eh?” Joe queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin refused to discuss the matter.\n",
      "\n",

      "you come off the wagon, Mart. Well, here’s how!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin drank on silently, biting out his orders and invitations and\n",
      "awing the barkeeper, an effeminate country youngster with watery blue\n",
      "eyes and hair parted in the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s something scandalous the way they work us poor devils,” Joe was\n",
      "remarking. “If I didn’t bowl up, I’d break loose an’ burn down the\n",

      "\n",
      "But Martin made no answer. A few more drinks, and in his brain he felt\n",
      "the maggots of intoxication beginning to crawl. Ah, it was living, the\n",
      "first breath of life he had breathed in three weeks. His dreams came\n",
      "back to him. Fancy came out of the darkened room and lured him on, a\n",
      "thing of flaming brightness. His mirror of vision was silver-clear, a\n",
      "flashing, dazzling palimpsest of imagery. Wonder and beauty walked with\n",
      "him, hand in hand, and all power was his. He tried to tell it to Joe,\n",
      "but Joe had visions of his own, infallible schemes whereby he would\n",

      "hear me talk! They’ll be machinery enough an’ hands enough to do it all\n",
      "in decent workin’ hours, an’ Mart, s’help me, I’ll make yeh\n",
      "superintendent of the shebang—the whole of it, all of it. Now here’s\n",

      "got in a half hour’s work before breakfast. Martin no longer took his\n",

      "Sometimes, in the steaming, sizzling heat, as he swung the heavy irons\n",
      "back and forth over the white garments, it came to him that it was a\n",
      "dream. In a short while, or maybe after a thousand years or so, he\n",
      "would awake, in his little room with the ink-stained table, and take up\n",
      "his writing where he had left off the day before. Or maybe that was a\n",

      "the handle-bars, his legs driving the ninety-six gear with rhythmic\n",
      "strength, his face set for seventy miles of road and grade and dust. He\n",
      "slept in Oakland that night, and on Sunday covered the seventy miles\n",
      "back. And on Monday morning, weary, he began the new week’s work, but\n",
      "he had kept sober.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fifth week passed, and a sixth, during which he lived and toiled as a\n",
      "machine, with just a spark of something more in him, just a glimmering\n",
      "bit of soul, that compelled him, at each week-end, to scorch off the\n",
      "hundred and forty miles. But this was not rest. It was\n",
      "super-machinelike, and it helped to crush out the glimmering bit of\n",
      "soul that was all that was left him from former life. At the end of the\n",
      "seventh week, without intending it, too weak to resist, he drifted down\n",
      "to the village with Joe and drowned life and found life until Monday\n",

      "\n",
      "Again, at the week-ends, he ground out the one hundred and forty miles,\n",
      "obliterating the numbness of too great exertion by the numbness of\n",
      "still greater exertion. At the end of three months he went down a third\n",
      "time to the village with Joe. He forgot, and lived again, and, living,\n",
      "he saw, in clear illumination, the beast he was making of himself—not\n",
      "by the drink, but by the work. The drink was an effect, not a cause. It\n",
      "followed inevitably upon the work, as the night follows upon the day.\n",
      "Not by becoming a toil-beast could he win to the heights, was the\n",
      "message the whiskey whispered to him, and he nodded approbation. The\n",
      "whiskey was wise. It told secrets on itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He called for paper and pencil, and for drinks all around, and while\n",
      "they drank his very good health, he clung to the bar and scribbled.\n",

      "out of the window at the sunshine and the trees.\n",

      "“Just look at it!” he cried. “An’ it’s all mine! It’s free. I can lie\n",

      "affect his love. His love was more ardent than ever, for he loved her\n",

      "shoulder. Sometimes they pored together over the printed pages of\n",
      "beauty. Then, too, she loved nature, and with generous imagination he\n",
      "changed the scene of their reading—sometimes they read in closed-in\n",
      "valleys with precipitous walls, or in high mountain meadows, and,\n",
      "again, down by the gray sand-dunes with a wreath of billows at their\n",
      "feet, or afar on some volcanic tropic isle where waterfalls descended\n",
      "and became mist, reaching the sea in vapor veils that swayed and\n",

      "filled, and filled without danger or penalty. This rough sailor-fellow\n",

      "would give him the right to marry, instead of paltering around with\n",

      "man’s work in the world like your father did, or like all our friends,\n",
      "Mr. Butler for one. Martin Eden, I am afraid, will never be a\n",
      "money-earner. And this world is so ordered that money is necessary to\n",

      "CHAPTER XX.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The desire to write was stirring in Martin once more. Stories and poems\n",
      "were springing into spontaneous creation in his brain, and he made\n",
      "notes of them against the future time when he would give them\n",
      "expression. But he did not write. This was his little vacation; he had\n",
      "resolved to devote it to rest and love, and in both matters he\n",
      "prospered. He was soon spilling over with vitality, and each day he saw\n",
      "Ruth, at the moment of meeting, she experienced the old shock of his\n",
      "strength and health.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be careful,” her mother warned her once again. “I am afraid you are\n",
      "seeing too much of Martin Eden.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Ruth laughed from security. She was sure of herself, and in a few\n",
      "days he would be off to sea. Then, by the time he returned, she would\n",
      "be away on her visit East. There was a magic, however, in the strength\n",
      "and health of Martin. He, too, had been told of her contemplated\n",
      "Eastern trip, and he felt the need for haste. Yet he did not know how\n",
      "to make love to a girl like Ruth. Then, too, he was handicapped by the\n",
      "possession of a great fund of experience with girls and women who had\n",
      "been absolutely different from her. They had known about love and life\n",
      "and flirtation, while she knew nothing about such things. Her\n",
      "prodigious innocence appalled him, freezing on his lips all ardors of\n",
      "speech, and convincing him, in spite of himself, of his own\n",
      "unworthiness. Also he was handicapped in another way. He had himself\n",
      "never been in love before. He had liked women in that turgid past of\n",
      "his, and been fascinated by some of them, but he had not known what it\n",
      "was to love them. He had whistled in a masterful, careless way, and\n",
      "they had come to him. They had been diversions, incidents, part of the\n",
      "game men play, but a small part at most. And now, and for the first\n",
      "time, he was a suppliant, tender and timid and doubting. He did not\n",
      "know the way of love, nor its speech, while he was frightened at his\n",
      "loved one’s clear innocence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of getting acquainted with a varied world, whirling on\n",
      "through the ever changing phases of it, he had learned a rule of\n",
      "conduct which was to the effect that when one played a strange game, he\n",
      "should let the other fellow play first. This had stood him in good\n",
      "stead a thousand times and trained him as an observer as well. He knew\n",
      "how to watch the thing that was strange, and to wait for a weakness,\n",
      "for a place of entrance, to divulge itself. It was like sparring for an\n",
      "opening in fist-fighting. And when such an opening came, he knew by\n",
      "long experience to play for it and to play hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he waited with Ruth and watched, desiring to speak his love but not\n",
      "daring. He was afraid of shocking her, and he was not sure of himself.\n",
      "Had he but known it, he was following the right course with her. Love\n",
      "came into the world before articulate speech, and in its own early\n",
      "youth it had learned ways and means that it had never forgotten. It was\n",
      "in this old, primitive way that Martin wooed Ruth. He did not know he\n",
      "was doing it at first, though later he divined it. The touch of his\n",
      "hand on hers was vastly more potent than any word he could utter, the\n",
      "impact of his strength on her imagination was more alluring than the\n",
      "printed poems and spoken passions of a thousand generations of lovers.\n",
      "Whatever his tongue could express would have appealed, in part, to her\n",
      "judgment; but the touch of hand, the fleeting contact, made its way\n",
      "directly to her instinct. Her judgment was as young as she, but her\n",
      "instincts were as old as the race and older. They had been young when\n",
      "love was young, and they were wiser than convention and opinion and all\n",
      "the new-born things. So her judgment did not act. There was no call\n",
      "upon it, and she did not realize the strength of the appeal Martin made\n",
      "from moment to moment to her love-nature. That he loved her, on the\n",
      "other hand, was as clear as day, and she consciously delighted in\n",
      "beholding his love-manifestations—the glowing eyes with their tender\n",
      "lights, the trembling hands, and the never failing swarthy flush that\n",
      "flooded darkly under his sunburn. She even went farther, in a timid way\n",
      "inciting him, but doing it so delicately that he never suspected, and\n",
      "doing it half-consciously, so that she scarcely suspected herself. She\n",
      "thrilled with these proofs of her power that proclaimed her a woman,\n",
      "and she took an Eve-like delight in tormenting him and playing upon\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tongue-tied by inexperience and by excess of ardor, wooing unwittingly\n",
      "and awkwardly, Martin continued his approach by contact. The touch of\n",
      "his hand was pleasant to her, and something deliciously more than\n",
      "pleasant. Martin did not know it, but he did know that it was not\n",
      "distasteful to her. Not that they touched hands often, save at meeting\n",
      "and parting; but that in handling the bicycles, in strapping on the\n",
      "books of verse they carried into the hills, and in conning the pages of\n",
      "books side by side, there were opportunities for hand to stray against\n",
      "hand. And there were opportunities, too, for her hair to brush his\n",
      "cheek, and for shoulder to touch shoulder, as they leaned together over\n",
      "the beauty of the books. She smiled to herself at vagrant impulses\n",
      "which arose from nowhere and suggested that she rumple his hair; while\n",
      "he desired greatly, when they tired of reading, to rest his head in her\n",
      "lap and dream with closed eyes about the future that was to be theirs.\n",

      "love. To rest his head in a girl’s lap had been the easiest thing in\n",
      "the world until now, and now he found Ruth’s lap inaccessible and\n",
      "impossible. Yet it was right here, in his reticence, that the strength\n",
      "of his wooing lay. It was because of this reticence that he never\n",

      "What had been done could be done again, and he, Martin Eden, could do\n",

      "volume of Spencer’s “Sociology” lying open on the bed. But he could not\n",
      "read. Love tormented him and overrode his will, so that, despite all\n",
      "determination, he found himself at the little ink-stained table. The\n",
      "sonnet he composed that night was the first of a love-cycle of fifty\n",
      "sonnets which was completed within two months. He had the “Love-sonnets\n",

      "headache that a moonlight sail on Lake Merritt was proposed by Norman\n",

      "\n",
      "The moon had not yet risen, and Ruth, gazing into the starry vault of\n",

      "feeling of loneliness. She glanced at him. A puff of wind was heeling\n",
      "the boat over till the deck was awash, and he, one hand on tiller and\n",
      "the other on main-sheet, was luffing slightly, at the same time peering\n",
      "ahead to make out the near-lying north shore. He was unaware of her\n",
      "gaze, and she watched him intently, speculating fancifully about the\n",
      "strange warp of soul that led him, a young man with signal powers, to\n",
      "fritter away his time on the writing of stories and poems foredoomed to\n",
      "mediocrity and failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her eyes wandered along the strong throat, dimly seen in the starlight,\n",
      "and over the firm-poised head, and the old desire to lay her hands upon\n",
      "his neck came back to her. The strength she abhorred attracted her. Her\n",
      "feeling of loneliness became more pronounced, and she felt tired. Her\n",
      "position on the heeling boat irked her, and she remembered the headache\n",
      "he had cured and the soothing rest that resided in him. He was sitting\n",
      "beside her, quite beside her, and the boat seemed to tilt her toward\n",
      "him. Then arose in her the impulse to lean against him, to rest herself\n",
      "against his strength—a vague, half-formed impulse, which, even as she\n",
      "considered it, mastered her and made her lean toward him. Or was it the\n",
      "heeling of the boat? She did not know. She never knew. She knew only\n",
      "that she was leaning against him and that the easement and soothing\n",
      "rest were very good. Perhaps it had been the boat’s fault, but she made\n",
      "no effort to retrieve it. She leaned lightly against his shoulder, but\n",
      "she leaned, and she continued to lean when he shifted his position to\n",
      "make it more comfortable for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a madness, but she refused to consider the madness. She was no\n",
      "longer herself but a woman, with a woman’s clinging need; and though\n",
      "she leaned ever so lightly, the need seemed satisfied. She was no\n",
      "longer tired. Martin did not speak. Had he, the spell would have been\n",
      "broken. But his reticence of love prolonged it. He was dazed and dizzy.\n",
      "He could not understand what was happening. It was too wonderful to be\n",
      "anything but a delirium. He conquered a mad desire to let go sheet and\n",
      "tiller and to clasp her in his arms. His intuition told him it was the\n",
      "wrong thing to do, and he was glad that sheet and tiller kept his hands\n",
      "occupied and fended off temptation. But he luffed the boat less\n",
      "delicately, spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to\n",
      "prolong the tack to the north shore. The shore would compel him to go\n",
      "about, and the contact would be broken. He sailed with skill, stopping\n",
      "way on the boat without exciting the notice of the wranglers, and\n",
      "mentally forgiving his hardest voyages in that they had made this\n",
      "marvellous night possible, giving him mastery over sea and boat and\n",
      "wind so that he could sail with her beside him, her dear weight against\n",
      "him on his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the first light of the rising moon touched the sail, illuminating\n",
      "the boat with pearly radiance, Ruth moved away from him. And, even as\n",
      "she moved, she felt him move away. The impulse to avoid detection was\n",
      "mutual. The episode was tacitly and secretly intimate. She sat apart\n",
      "from him with burning cheeks, while the full force of it came home to\n",
      "her. She had been guilty of something she would not have her brothers\n",
      "see, nor Olney see. Why had she done it? She had never done anything\n",
      "like it in her life, and yet she had been moonlight-sailing with young\n",
      "men before. She had never desired to do anything like it. She was\n",
      "overcome with shame and with the mystery of her own burgeoning\n",
      "womanhood. She stole a glance at Martin, who was busy putting the boat\n",
      "about on the other tack, and she could have hated him for having made\n",
      "her do an immodest and shameful thing. And he, of all men! Perhaps her\n",
      "mother was right, and she was seeing too much of him. It would never\n",
      "happen again, she resolved, and she would see less of him in the\n",
      "future. She entertained a wild idea of explaining to him the first time\n",
      "they were alone together, of lying to him, of mentioning casually the\n",
      "attack of faintness that had overpowered her just before the moon came\n",
      "up. Then she remembered how they had drawn mutually away before the\n",
      "revealing moon, and she knew he would know it for a lie.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the days that swiftly followed she was no longer herself but a\n",
      "strange, puzzling creature, wilful over judgment and scornful of\n",
      "self-analysis, refusing to peer into the future or to think about\n",
      "herself and whither she was drifting. She was in a fever of tingling\n",
      "mystery, alternately frightened and charmed, and in constant\n",
      "bewilderment. She had one idea firmly fixed, however, which insured her\n",
      "security. She would not let Martin speak his love. As long as she did\n",
      "this, all would be well. In a few days he would be off to sea. And even\n",
      "if he did speak, all would be well. It could not be otherwise, for she\n",
      "did not love him. Of course, it would be a painful half hour for him,\n",
      "and an embarrassing half hour for her, because it would be her first\n",
      "proposal. She thrilled deliciously at the thought. She was really a\n",
      "woman, with a man ripe to ask for her in marriage. It was a lure to all\n",
      "that was fundamental in her sex. The fabric of her life, of all that\n",
      "constituted her, quivered and grew tremulous. The thought fluttered in\n",
      "her mind like a flame-attracted moth. She went so far as to imagine\n",
      "Martin proposing, herself putting the words into his mouth; and she\n",
      "rehearsed her refusal, tempering it with kindness and exhorting him to\n",
      "true and noble manhood. And especially he must stop smoking cigarettes.\n",
      "She would make a point of that. But no, she must not let him speak at\n",
      "all. She could stop him, and she had told her mother that she would.\n",
      "All flushed and burning, she regretfully dismissed the conjured\n",

      "Came a beautiful fall day, warm and languid, palpitant with the hush of\n",
      "the changing season, a California Indian summer day, with hazy sun and\n",
      "wandering wisps of breeze that did not stir the slumber of the air.\n",
      "Filmy purple mists, that were not vapors but fabrics woven of color,\n",
      "hid in the recesses of the hills. San Francisco lay like a blur of\n",
      "smoke upon her heights. The intervening bay was a dull sheen of molten\n",
      "metal, whereon sailing craft lay motionless or drifted with the lazy\n",
      "tide. Far Tamalpais, barely seen in the silver haze, bulked hugely by\n",
      "the Golden Gate, the latter a pale gold pathway under the westering\n",
      "sun. Beyond, the Pacific, dim and vast, was raising on its sky-line\n",
      "tumbled cloud-masses that swept landward, giving warning of the first\n",
      "blustering breath of winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The erasure of summer was at hand. Yet summer lingered, fading and\n",
      "fainting among her hills, deepening the purple of her valleys, spinning\n",
      "a shroud of haze from waning powers and sated raptures, dying with the\n",
      "calm content of having lived and lived well. And among the hills, on\n",
      "their favorite knoll, Martin and Ruth sat side by side, their heads\n",
      "bent over the same pages, he reading aloud from the love-sonnets of the\n",
      "woman who had loved Browning as it is given to few men to be loved.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the reading languished. The spell of passing beauty all about them\n",
      "was too strong. The golden year was dying as it had lived, a beautiful\n",
      "and unrepentant voluptuary, and reminiscent rapture and content\n",
      "freighted heavily the air. It entered into them, dreamy and languorous,\n",
      "weakening the fibres of resolution, suffusing the face of morality, or\n",
      "of judgment, with haze and purple mist. Martin felt tender and melting,\n",
      "and from time to time warm glows passed over him. His head was very\n",
      "near to hers, and when wandering phantoms of breeze stirred her hair so\n",
      "that it touched his face, the printed pages swam before his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t believe you know a word of what you are reading,” she said\n",
      "once when he had lost his place.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at her with burning eyes, and was on the verge of becoming\n",
      "awkward, when a retort came to his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t believe you know either. What was the last sonnet about?”\n",

      "The book slipped from his hands to the ground, and they sat idly and\n",
      "silently, gazing out over the dreamy bay with eyes that dreamed and did\n",
      "not see. Ruth glanced sidewise at his neck. She did not lean toward\n",
      "him. She was drawn by some force outside of herself and stronger than\n",
      "gravitation, strong as destiny. It was only an inch to lean, and it was\n",
      "accomplished without volition on her part. Her shoulder touched his as\n",
      "lightly as a butterfly touches a flower, and just as lightly was the\n",
      "counter-pressure. She felt his shoulder press hers, and a tremor run\n",
      "through him. Then was the time for her to draw back. But she had become\n",
      "an automaton. Her actions had passed beyond the control of her will—she\n",
      "never thought of control or will in the delicious madness that was upon\n",
      "her. His arm began to steal behind her and around her. She waited its\n",
      "slow progress in a torment of delight. She waited, she knew not for\n",
      "what, panting, with dry, burning lips, a leaping pulse, and a fever of\n",
      "expectancy in all her blood. The girdling arm lifted higher and drew\n",
      "her toward him, drew her slowly and caressingly. She could wait no\n",
      "longer. With a tired sigh, and with an impulsive movement all her own,\n",
      "unpremeditated, spasmodic, she rested her head upon his breast. His\n",
      "head bent over swiftly, and, as his lips approached, hers flew to meet\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This must be love, she thought, in the one rational moment that was\n",
      "vouchsafed her. If it was not love, it was too shameful. It could be\n",

      "and whose lips were pressed to hers. She pressed more tightly to him,\n",
      "with a snuggling movement of her body. And a moment later, tearing\n",
      "herself half out of his embrace, suddenly and exultantly she reached up\n",
      "and placed both hands upon Martin Eden’s sunburnt neck. So exquisite\n",
      "was the pang of love and desire fulfilled that she uttered a low moan,\n",
      "relaxed her hands, and lay half-swooning in his arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a word had been spoken, and not a word was spoken for a long time.\n",
      "Twice he bent and kissed her, and each time her lips met his shyly and\n",
      "her body made its happy, nestling movement. She clung to him, unable to\n",
      "release herself, and he sat, half supporting her in his arms, as he\n",
      "gazed with unseeing eyes at the blur of the great city across the bay.\n",
      "For once there were no visions in his brain. Only colors and lights and\n",
      "glows pulsed there, warm as the day and warm as his love. He bent over\n",

      "“When did you love me?” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From the first, the very first, the first moment I laid eye on you. I\n",

      "then I have only grown the madder. I am maddest, now, dear. I am almost\n",

      "“Oh, I knew it all the time, almost, from the first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I have been as blind as a bat!” he cried, a ring of vexation in\n",

      "\n",
      "“I didn’t mean that.” She drew herself partly away and looked at him.\n",

      "\n",
      "“And you?” he demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It came to me suddenly.” She was speaking very slowly, her eyes warm\n",
      "and fluttery and melting, a soft flush on her cheeks that did not go\n",
      "away. “I never knew until just now when—you put your arms around me.\n",
      "And I never expected to marry you, Martin, not until just now. How did\n",
      "you make me love you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” he laughed, “unless just by loving you, for I loved you\n",
      "hard enough to melt the heart of a stone, much less the heart of the\n",
      "living, breathing woman you are.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "He offered to draw her toward him again, but it was no more than a\n",
      "tentative muscular movement of the girdling arm, for he feared that he\n",

      "close in his arms and lips were pressed on lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What will my people say?” she queried, with sudden apprehension, in\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Do you know, Martin, you sometimes frighten me. I am frightened now,\n",

      "true, he decided; though the novels he had read had led him to believe\n",
      "otherwise. His idea, for which the novels were responsible, had been\n",
      "that only formal proposals obtained in the upper classes. It was all\n",
      "right enough, down whence he had come, for youths and maidens to win\n",
      "each other by contact; but for the exalted personages up above on the\n",

      "caresses, unaccompanied by speech, that were efficacious with the girls\n",
      "of the working-class, were equally efficacious with the girls above the\n",
      "working-class. They were all of the same flesh, after all, sisters\n",
      "under their skins; and he might have known as much himself had he\n",
      "remembered his Spencer. As he held Ruth in his arms and soothed her, he\n",
      "took great consolation in the thought that the Colonel’s lady and Judy\n",
      "O’Grady were pretty much alike under their skins. It brought Ruth\n",

      "flesh, as his flesh. There was no bar to their marriage. Class\n",

      "arm around me. And—and I was not myself. And he kissed me, and I kissed\n",

      "\n",
      "“We have other plans for you, Ruth, dear, your father and I—oh, no, no;\n",

      "him.”\n",

      "“We would not influence your choice in any way; but you are our\n",

      "this. He has nothing but roughness and coarseness to offer you in\n",
      "exchange for all that is refined and delicate in you. He is no match\n",
      "for you in any way. He could not support you. We have no foolish ideas\n",
      "about wealth, but comfort is another matter, and our daughter should at\n",
      "least marry a man who can give her that—and not a penniless adventurer,\n",
      "a sailor, a cowboy, a smuggler, and Heaven knows what else, who, in\n",

      "man thinking of marriage should be preparing for marriage. But not he.\n",
      "As I have said, and I know you agree with me, he is irresponsible. And\n",
      "why should he not be? It is the way of sailors. He has never learned to\n",
      "be economical or temperate. The spendthrift years have marked him. It\n",
      "is not his fault, of course, but that does not alter his nature. And\n",
      "have you thought of the years of licentiousness he inevitably has\n",

      "\n",
      "Ruth shuddered and clung close to her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have thought.” Ruth waited a long time for the thought to frame\n",
      "itself. “And it is terrible. It sickens me to think of it. I told you\n",
      "it was a dreadful accident, my loving him; but I can’t help myself.\n",
      "Could you help loving father? Then it is the same with me. There is\n",
      "something in me, in him—I never knew it was there until to-day—but it\n",

      "you see, I do,” she concluded, a certain faint triumph in her voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked long, and to little purpose, in conclusion agreeing to wait\n",

      "The same conclusion was reached, a little later that night, between\n",
      "Mrs. Morse and her husband, after she had made due confession of the\n",
      "miscarriage of her plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It could hardly have come otherwise,” was Mr. Morse’s judgment. “This\n",
      "sailor-fellow has been the only man she was in touch with. Sooner or\n",
      "later she was going to awaken anyway; and she did awaken, and lo! here\n",
      "was this sailor-fellow, the only accessible man at the moment, and of\n",
      "course she promptly loved him, or thought she did, which amounts to the\n",
      "same thing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Morse took it upon herself to work slowly and indirectly upon\n",
      "Ruth, rather than to combat her. There would be plenty of time for\n",
      "this, for Martin was not in position to marry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let her see all she wants of him,” was Mr. Morse’s advice. “The more\n",
      "she knows him, the less she’ll love him, I wager. And give her plenty\n",
      "of contrast. Make a point of having young people at the house. Young\n",
      "women and young men, all sorts of young men, clever men, men who have\n",
      "done something or who are doing things, men of her own class,\n",
      "gentlemen. She can gauge him by them. They will show him up for what he\n",
      "is. And after all, he is a mere boy of twenty-one. Ruth is no more than\n",
      "a child. It is calf love with the pair of them, and they will grow out\n",
      "of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So the matter rested. Within the family it was accepted that Ruth and\n",
      "Martin were engaged, but no announcement was made. The family did not\n",
      "think it would ever be necessary. Also, it was tacitly understood that\n",
      "it was to be a long engagement. They did not ask Martin to go to work,\n",
      "nor to cease writing. They did not intend to encourage him to mend\n",
      "himself. And he aided and abetted them in their unfriendly designs, for\n",
      "going to work was farthest from his thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder if you’ll like what I have done!” he said to Ruth several\n",
      "days later. “I’ve decided that boarding with my sister is too\n",
      "expensive, and I am going to board myself. I’ve rented a little room\n",
      "out in North Oakland, retired neighborhood and all the rest, you know,\n",
      "and I’ve bought an oil-burner on which to cook.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth was overjoyed. The oil-burner especially pleased her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was the way Mr. Butler began his start,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin frowned inwardly at the citation of that worthy gentleman, and\n",
      "went on: “I put stamps on all my manuscripts and started them off to\n",
      "the editors again. Then to-day I moved in, and to-morrow I start to\n",
      "work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A position!” she cried, betraying the gladness of her surprise in all\n",
      "her body, nestling closer to him, pressing his hand, smiling. “And you\n",
      "never told me! What is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I meant that I was going to work at my writing.” Her face fell, and he\n",
      "went on hastily. “Don’t misjudge me. I am not going in this time with\n",
      "any iridescent ideas. It is to be a cold, prosaic, matter-of-fact\n",
      "business proposition. It is better than going to sea again, and I shall\n",
      "earn more money than any position in Oakland can bring an unskilled\n",
      "man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, this vacation I have taken has given me perspective. I\n",
      "haven’t been working the life out of my body, and I haven’t been\n",
      "writing, at least not for publication. All I’ve done has been to love\n",
      "you and to think. I’ve read some, too, but it has been part of my\n",
      "thinking, and I have read principally magazines. I have generalized\n",
      "about myself, and the world, my place in it, and my chance to win to a\n",
      "place that will be fit for you. Also, I’ve been reading Spencer’s\n",
      "‘Philosophy of Style,’ and found out a lot of what was the matter with\n",
      "me—or my writing, rather; and for that matter with most of the writing\n",
      "that is published every month in the magazines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the upshot of it all—of my thinking and reading and loving—is that\n",
      "I am going to move to Grub Street. I shall leave masterpieces alone and\n",
      "do hack-work—jokes, paragraphs, feature articles, humorous verse, and\n",
      "society verse—all the rot for which there seems so much demand. Then\n",
      "there are the newspaper syndicates, and the newspaper short-story\n",
      "syndicates, and the syndicates for the Sunday supplements. I can go\n",
      "ahead and hammer out the stuff they want, and earn the equivalent of a\n",
      "good salary by it. There are free-lances, you know, who earn as much as\n",
      "four or five hundred a month. I don’t care to become as they; but I’ll\n",
      "earn a good living, and have plenty of time to myself, which I wouldn’t\n",

      "the grind I’ll try my hand at masterpieces, and I’ll study and prepare\n",
      "myself for the writing of masterpieces. Why, I am amazed at the\n",
      "distance I have come already. When I first tried to write, I had\n",
      "nothing to write about except a few paltry experiences which I neither\n",
      "understood nor appreciated. But I had no thoughts. I really didn’t. I\n",
      "didn’t even have the words with which to think. My experiences were so\n",
      "many meaningless pictures. But as I began to add to my knowledge, and\n",
      "to my vocabulary, I saw something more in my experiences than mere\n",
      "pictures. I retained the pictures and I found their interpretation.\n",
      "That was when I began to do good work, when I wrote ‘Adventure,’ ‘Joy,’\n",
      "‘The Pot,’ ‘The Wine of Life,’ ‘The Jostling Street,’ the ‘Love-cycle,’\n",
      "and the ‘Sea Lyrics.’ I shall write more like them, and better; but I\n",
      "shall do it in my spare time. My feet are on the solid earth, now.\n",
      "Hack-work and income first, masterpieces afterward. Just to show you, I\n",
      "wrote half a dozen jokes last night for the comic weeklies; and just as\n",
      "I was going to bed, the thought struck me to try my hand at a triolet—a\n",
      "humorous one; and inside an hour I had written four. They ought to be\n",
      "worth a dollar apiece. Four dollars right there for a few afterthoughts\n",
      "on the way to bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it’s all valueless, just so much dull and sordid plodding;\n",
      "but it is no more dull and sordid than keeping books at sixty dollars a\n",
      "month, adding up endless columns of meaningless figures until one dies.\n",

      "the brains of her brothers, or the brain of her father. In spite of\n",
      "every advantage of university training, and in the face of her\n",
      "bachelorship of arts, his power of intellect overshadowed hers, and his\n",
      "year or so of self-study and equipment gave him a mastery of the\n",

      "possess.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this he realized, but it did not affect his love for her, nor her\n",

      "for him to besmirch love with criticism. What did love have to do with\n",
      "Ruth’s divergent views on art, right conduct, the French Revolution, or\n",
      "equal suffrage? They were mental processes, but love was beyond reason;\n",
      "it was superrational. He could not belittle love. He worshipped it.\n",
      "Love lay on the mountain-tops beyond the valley-land of reason. It was\n",
      "a sublimated condition of existence, the topmost peak of living, and it\n",
      "came rarely. Thanks to the school of scientific philosophers he\n",
      "favored, he knew the biological significance of love; but by a refined\n",
      "process of the same scientific reasoning he reached the conclusion that\n",
      "the human organism achieved its highest purpose in love, that love must\n",
      "not be questioned, but must be accepted as the highest guerdon of life.\n",
      "Thus, he considered the lover blessed over all creatures, and it was a\n",
      "delight to him to think of “God’s own mad lover,” rising above the\n",
      "things of earth, above wealth and judgment, public opinion and\n",
      "applause, rising above life itself and “dying on a kiss.”\n",

      "Much of this Martin had already reasoned out, and some of it he\n",
      "reasoned out later. In the meantime he worked, taking no recreation\n",
      "except when he went to see Ruth, and living like a Spartan. He paid two\n",
      "dollars and a half a month rent for the small room he got from his\n",
      "Portuguese landlady, Maria Silva, a virago and a widow, hard working\n",
      "and harsher tempered, rearing her large brood of children somehow, and\n",
      "drowning her sorrow and fatigue at irregular intervals in a gallon of\n",
      "the thin, sour wine that she bought from the corner grocery and saloon\n",
      "for fifteen cents. From detesting her and her foul tongue at first,\n",
      "Martin grew to admire her as he observed the brave fight she made.\n",
      "There were but four rooms in the little house—three, when Martin’s was\n",
      "subtracted. One of these, the parlor, gay with an ingrain carpet and\n",
      "dolorous with a funeral card and a death-picture of one of her numerous\n",
      "departed babes, was kept strictly for company. The blinds were always\n",
      "down, and her barefooted tribe was never permitted to enter the sacred\n",
      "precinct save on state occasions. She cooked, and all ate, in the\n",
      "kitchen, where she likewise washed, starched, and ironed clothes on all\n",
      "days of the week except Sunday; for her income came largely from taking\n",
      "in washing from her more prosperous neighbors. Remained the bedroom,\n",
      "small as the one occupied by Martin, into which she and her seven\n",
      "little ones crowded and slept. It was an everlasting miracle to Martin\n",
      "how it was accomplished, and from her side of the thin partition he\n",
      "heard nightly every detail of the going to bed, the squalls and\n",
      "squabbles, the soft chattering, and the sleepy, twittering noises as of\n",
      "birds. Another source of income to Maria were her cows, two of them,\n",
      "which she milked night and morning and which gained a surreptitious\n",
      "livelihood from vacant lots and the grass that grew on either side the\n",
      "public side walks, attended always by one or more of her ragged boys,\n",

      "In his own small room Martin lived, slept, studied, wrote, and kept\n",
      "house. Before the one window, looking out on the tiny front porch, was\n",
      "the kitchen table that served as desk, library, and type-writing stand.\n",
      "The bed, against the rear wall, occupied two-thirds of the total space\n",
      "of the room. The table was flanked on one side by a gaudy bureau,\n",
      "manufactured for profit and not for service, the thin veneer of which\n",
      "was shed day by day. This bureau stood in the corner, and in the\n",
      "opposite corner, on the table’s other flank, was the kitchen—the\n",
      "oil-stove on a dry-goods box, inside of which were dishes and cooking\n",
      "utensils, a shelf on the wall for provisions, and a bucket of water on\n",
      "the floor. Martin had to carry his water from the kitchen sink, there\n",
      "being no tap in his room. On days when there was much steam to his\n",
      "cooking, the harvest of veneer from the bureau was unusually generous.\n",
      "Over the bed, hoisted by a tackle to the ceiling, was his bicycle. At\n",
      "first he had tried to keep it in the basement; but the tribe of Silva,\n",
      "loosening the bearings and puncturing the tires, had driven him out.\n",
      "Next he attempted the tiny front porch, until a howling southeaster\n",
      "drenched the wheel a night-long. Then he had retreated with it to his\n",
      "room and slung it aloft.\n",
      "\n",
      "A small closet contained his clothes and the books he had accumulated\n",
      "and for which there was no room on the table or under the table. Hand\n",
      "in hand with reading, he had developed the habit of making notes, and\n",
      "so copiously did he make them that there would have been no existence\n",
      "for him in the confined quarters had he not rigged several\n",
      "clothes-lines across the room on which the notes were hung. Even so, he\n",
      "was crowded until navigating the room was a difficult task. He could\n",
      "not open the door without first closing the closet door, and _vice\n",
      "versa_. It was impossible for him anywhere to traverse the room in a\n",
      "straight line. To go from the door to the head of the bed was a zigzag\n",
      "course that he was never quite able to accomplish in the dark without\n",
      "collisions. Having settled the difficulty of the conflicting doors, he\n",
      "had to steer sharply to the right to avoid the kitchen. Next, he\n",
      "sheered to the left, to escape the foot of the bed; but this sheer, if\n",
      "too generous, brought him against the corner of the table. With a\n",
      "sudden twitch and lurch, he terminated the sheer and bore off to the\n",
      "right along a sort of canal, one bank of which was the bed, the other\n",
      "the table. When the one chair in the room was at its usual place before\n",
      "the table, the canal was unnavigable. When the chair was not in use, it\n",
      "reposed on top of the bed, though sometimes he sat on the chair when\n",
      "cooking, reading a book while the water boiled, and even becoming\n",
      "skilful enough to manage a paragraph or two while steak was frying.\n",
      "Also, so small was the little corner that constituted the kitchen, he\n",
      "was able, sitting down, to reach anything he needed. In fact, it was\n",
      "expedient to cook sitting down; standing up, he was too often in his\n",
      "own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conjunction with a perfect stomach that could digest anything, he\n",
      "possessed knowledge of the various foods that were at the same time\n",
      "nutritious and cheap. Pea-soup was a common article in his diet, as\n",
      "well as potatoes and beans, the latter large and brown and cooked in\n",
      "Mexican style. Rice, cooked as American housewives never cook it and\n",
      "can never learn to cook it, appeared on Martin’s table at least once a\n",
      "day. Dried fruits were less expensive than fresh, and he had usually a\n",
      "pot of them, cooked and ready at hand, for they took the place of\n",
      "butter on his bread. Occasionally he graced his table with a piece of\n",
      "round-steak, or with a soup-bone. Coffee, without cream or milk, he had\n",
      "twice a day, in the evening substituting tea; but both coffee and tea\n",
      "were excellently cooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was need for him to be economical. His vacation had consumed\n",
      "nearly all he had earned in the laundry, and he was so far from his\n",
      "market that weeks must elapse before he could hope for the first\n",
      "returns from his hack-work. Except at such times as he saw Ruth, or\n",
      "dropped in to see his sister Gertude, he lived a recluse, in each day\n",
      "accomplishing at least three days’ labor of ordinary men. He slept a\n",
      "scant five hours, and only one with a constitution of iron could have\n",
      "held himself down, as Martin did, day after day, to nineteen\n",
      "consecutive hours of toil. He never lost a moment. On the looking-glass\n",
      "were lists of definitions and pronunciations; when shaving, or\n",
      "dressing, or combing his hair, he conned these lists over. Similar\n",
      "lists were on the wall over the oil-stove, and they were similarly\n",
      "conned while he was engaged in cooking or in washing the dishes. New\n",
      "lists continually displaced the old ones. Every strange or partly\n",
      "familiar word encountered in his reading was immediately jotted down,\n",
      "and later, when a sufficient number had been accumulated, were typed\n",
      "and pinned to the wall or looking-glass. He even carried them in his\n",
      "pockets, and reviewed them at odd moments on the street, or while\n",
      "waiting in butcher shop or grocery to be served.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went farther in the matter. Reading the works of men who had\n",
      "arrived, he noted every result achieved by them, and worked out the\n",
      "tricks by which they had been achieved—the tricks of narrative, of\n",
      "exposition, of style, the points of view, the contrasts, the epigrams;\n",
      "and of all these he made lists for study. He did not ape. He sought\n",
      "principles. He drew up lists of effective and fetching mannerisms, till\n",
      "out of many such, culled from many writers, he was able to induce the\n",
      "general principle of mannerism, and, thus equipped, to cast about for\n",
      "new and original ones of his own, and to weigh and measure and appraise\n",
      "them properly. In similar manner he collected lists of strong phrases,\n",
      "the phrases of living language, phrases that bit like acid and scorched\n",
      "like flame, or that glowed and were mellow and luscious in the midst of\n",
      "the arid desert of common speech. He sought always for the principle\n",
      "that lay behind and beneath. He wanted to know how the thing was done;\n",
      "after that he could do it for himself. He was not content with the fair\n",
      "face of beauty. He dissected beauty in his crowded little bedroom\n",
      "laboratory, where cooking smells alternated with the outer bedlam of\n",
      "the Silva tribe; and, having dissected and learned the anatomy of\n",
      "beauty, he was nearer being able to create beauty itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was so made that he could work only with understanding. He could not\n",
      "work blindly, in the dark, ignorant of what he was producing and\n",
      "trusting to chance and the star of his genius that the effect produced\n",
      "should be right and fine. He had no patience with chance effects. He\n",
      "wanted to know why and how. His was deliberate creative genius, and,\n",
      "before he began a story or poem, the thing itself was already alive in\n",
      "his brain, with the end in sight and the means of realizing that end in\n",
      "his conscious possession. Otherwise the effort was doomed to failure.\n",
      "On the other hand, he appreciated the chance effects in words and\n",
      "phrases that came lightly and easily into his brain, and that later\n",
      "stood all tests of beauty and power and developed tremendous and\n",
      "incommunicable connotations. Before such he bowed down and marvelled,\n",
      "knowing that they were beyond the deliberate creation of any man. And\n",
      "no matter how much he dissected beauty in search of the principles that\n",
      "underlie beauty and make beauty possible, he was aware, always, of the\n",
      "innermost mystery of beauty to which he did not penetrate and to which\n",
      "no man had ever penetrated. He knew full well, from his Spencer, that\n",
      "man can never attain ultimate knowledge of anything, and that the\n",
      "mystery of beauty was no less than that of life—nay, more—that the\n",
      "fibres of beauty and life were intertwisted, and that he himself was\n",
      "but a bit of the same nonunderstandable fabric, twisted of sunshine and\n",
      "star-dust and wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, it was when filled with these thoughts that he wrote his essay\n",
      "entitled “Star-dust,” in which he had his fling, not at the principles\n",
      "of criticism, but at the principal critics. It was brilliant, deep,\n",
      "philosophical, and deliciously touched with laughter. Also it was\n",
      "promptly rejected by the magazines as often as it was submitted. But\n",
      "having cleared his mind of it, he went serenely on his way. It was a\n",
      "habit he developed, of incubating and maturing his thought upon a\n",
      "subject, and of then rushing into the type-writer with it. That it did\n",
      "not see print was a matter of small moment with him. The writing of it\n",
      "was the culminating act of a long mental process, the drawing together\n",
      "of scattered threads of thought and the final generalizing upon all the\n",
      "data with which his mind was burdened. To write such an article was the\n",
      "conscious effort by which he freed his mind and made it ready for fresh\n",
      "material and problems. It was in a way akin to that common habit of men\n",
      "and women troubled by real or fancied grievances, who periodically and\n",

      "The weeks passed. Martin ran out of money, and publishers’ checks were\n",
      "far away as ever. All his important manuscripts had come back and been\n",
      "started out again, and his hack-work fared no better. His little\n",
      "kitchen was no longer graced with a variety of foods. Caught in the\n",
      "pinch with a part sack of rice and a few pounds of dried apricots, rice\n",
      "and apricots was his menu three times a day for five days hand-running.\n",
      "Then he startled to realize on his credit. The Portuguese grocer, to\n",
      "whom he had hitherto paid cash, called a halt when Martin’s bill\n",
      "reached the magnificent total of three dollars and eighty-five cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For you see,” said the grocer, “you no catcha da work, I losa da\n",
      "mon’.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Martin could reply nothing. There was no way of explaining. It was\n",
      "not true business principle to allow credit to a strong-bodied young\n",
      "fellow of the working-class who was too lazy to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You catcha da job, I let you have mora da grub,” the grocer assured\n",
      "Martin. “No job, no grub. Thata da business.” And then, to show that it\n",
      "was purely business foresight and not prejudice, “Hava da drink on da\n",
      "house—good friends justa da same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Martin drank, in his easy way, to show that he was good friends with\n",

      "The fruit store, where Martin had bought his vegetables, was run by an\n",
      "American whose business principles were so weak that he let Martin run\n",
      "a bill of five dollars before stopping his credit. The baker stopped at\n",
      "two dollars, and the butcher at four dollars. Martin added his debts\n",
      "and found that he was possessed of a total credit in all the world of\n",
      "fourteen dollars and eighty-five cents. He was up with his type-writer\n",
      "rent, but he estimated that he could get two months’ credit on that,\n",
      "which would be eight dollars. When that occurred, he would have\n",
      "exhausted all possible credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last purchase from the fruit store had been a sack of potatoes, and\n",
      "for a week he had potatoes, and nothing but potatoes, three times a\n",
      "day. An occasional dinner at Ruth’s helped to keep strength in his\n",
      "body, though he found it tantalizing enough to refuse further helping\n",

      "Now and again, though afflicted with secret shame, he dropped in at his\n",

      "Day by day he worked on, and day by day the postman delivered to him\n",
      "rejected manuscripts. He had no money for stamps, so the manuscripts\n",
      "accumulated in a heap under the table. Came a day when for forty hours\n",
      "he had not tasted food. He could not hope for a meal at Ruth’s, for she\n",

      "he could not go to his sister’s. To cap misfortune, the postman, in his\n",
      "afternoon round, brought him five returned manuscripts. Then it was\n",
      "that Martin wore his overcoat down into Oakland, and came back without\n",
      "it, but with five dollars tinkling in his pocket. He paid a dollar each\n",
      "on account to the four tradesmen, and in his kitchen fried steak and\n",
      "onions, made coffee, and stewed a large pot of prunes. And having\n",
      "dined, he sat down at his table-desk and completed before midnight an\n",
      "essay which he entitled “The Dignity of Usury.” Having typed it out, he\n",
      "flung it under the table, for there had been nothing left from the five\n",

      "Later on he pawned his watch, and still later his wheel, reducing the\n",
      "amount available for food by putting stamps on all his manuscripts and\n",
      "sending them out. He was disappointed with his hack-work. Nobody cared\n",
      "to buy. He compared it with what he found in the newspapers, weeklies,\n",
      "and cheap magazines, and decided that his was better, far better, than\n",
      "the average; yet it would not sell. Then he discovered that most of the\n",
      "newspapers printed a great deal of what was called “plate” stuff, and\n",
      "he got the address of the association that furnished it. His own work\n",
      "that he sent in was returned, along with a stereotyped slip informing\n",

      "In one of the great juvenile periodicals he noted whole columns of\n",
      "incident and anecdote. Here was a chance. His paragraphs were returned,\n",
      "and though he tried repeatedly he never succeeded in placing one. Later\n",
      "on, when it no longer mattered, he learned that the associate editors\n",
      "and sub-editors augmented their salaries by supplying those paragraphs\n",
      "themselves. The comic weeklies returned his jokes and humorous verse,\n",
      "and the light society verse he wrote for the large magazines found no\n",
      "abiding-place. Then there was the newspaper storiette. He knew that he\n",
      "could write better ones than were published. Managing to obtain the\n",
      "addresses of two newspaper syndicates, he deluged them with storiettes.\n",
      "When he had written twenty and failed to place one of them, he ceased.\n",
      "And yet, from day to day, he read storiettes in the dailies and\n",
      "weeklies, scores and scores of storiettes, not one of which would\n",
      "compare with his. In his despondency, he concluded that he had no\n",

      "was a self-deluded pretender.\n",
      "\n",

      "stamps in with his manuscript, dropped it into the letter-box, and from\n",
      "three weeks to a month afterward the postman came up the steps and\n",
      "handed him the manuscript. Surely there were no live, warm editors at\n",
      "the other end. It was all wheels and cogs and oil-cups—a clever\n",
      "mechanism operated by automatons. He reached stages of despair wherein\n",
      "he doubted if editors existed at all. He had never received a sign of\n",
      "the existence of one, and from absence of judgment in rejecting all he\n",

      "was far away as ever. He had asked for two years; time was flying, and\n",
      "he was achieving nothing. Again, he was always conscious of the fact\n",
      "that she did not approve what he was doing. She did not say so\n",

      "university on the conventions of the arts.) “In painting there are only\n",
      "two dimensions to the canvas, yet you accept the illusion of three\n",
      "dimensions which the art of a painter enables him to throw into the\n",
      "canvas. In writing, again, the author must be omnipotent. You accept as\n",
      "perfectly legitimate the author’s account of the secret thoughts of the\n",
      "heroine, and yet all the time you know that the heroine was alone when\n",
      "thinking these thoughts, and that neither the author nor any one else\n",
      "was capable of hearing them. And so with the stage, with sculpture,\n",
      "with opera, with every art form. Certain irreconcilable things must be\n",
      "accepted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I understood that,” Martin answered. “All the arts have their\n",

      "he had studied at the university himself, instead of being ill-equipped\n",
      "from browsing at haphazard through the books in the library.) “But even\n",
      "the conventions must be real. Trees, painted on flat cardboard and\n",
      "stuck up on each side of the stage, we accept as a forest. It is a real\n",
      "enough convention. But, on the other hand, we would not accept a sea\n",
      "scene as a forest. We can’t do it. It violates our senses. Nor would\n",
      "you, or, rather, should you, accept the ravings and writhings and\n",

      "portrayal of love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you don’t hold yourself superior to all the judges of music?” she\n",
      "protested.\n",

      "“No, no, not for a moment. I merely maintain my right as an individual.\n",
      "I have just been telling you what I think, in order to explain why the\n",

      "world’s judges of music may all be right. But I am I, and I won’t\n",
      "subordinate my taste to the unanimous judgment of mankind. If I don’t\n",

      "sentimental tears to-night, and the clownish antics of that precious\n",
      "pair would have but enhanced the beauty of their voices and the beauty\n",

      "thoughts made no impression upon her. She was too firmly intrenched in\n",
      "the established to have any sympathy with revolutionary ideas. She had\n",
      "always been used to music, and she had enjoyed opera ever since she was\n",
      "a child, and all her world had enjoyed it, too. Then by what right did\n",

      "she considered the statement of his views to be a caprice, an erratic\n",
      "and uncalled-for prank. But when he took her in his arms at the door\n",
      "and kissed her good night in tender lover-fashion, she forgot\n",
      "everything in the outrush of her own love to him. And later, on a\n",

      "Maria Silva was poor, and all the ways of poverty were clear to her.\n",
      "Poverty, to Ruth, was a word signifying a not-nice condition of\n",
      "existence. That was her total knowledge on the subject. She knew Martin\n",
      "was poor, and his condition she associated in her mind with the boyhood\n",
      "of Abraham Lincoln, of Mr. Butler, and of other men who had become\n",
      "successes. Also, while aware that poverty was anything but delectable,\n",
      "she had a comfortable middle-class feeling that poverty was salutary,\n",
      "that it was a sharp spur that urged on to success all men who were not\n",
      "degraded and hopeless drudges. So that her knowledge that Martin was so\n",
      "poor that he had pawned his watch and overcoat did not disturb her. She\n",
      "even considered it the hopeful side of the situation, believing that\n",
      "sooner or later it would arouse him and compel him to abandon his\n",
      "writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth never read hunger in Martin’s face, which had grown lean and had\n",
      "enlarged the slight hollows in the cheeks. In fact, she marked the\n",
      "change in his face with satisfaction. It seemed to refine him, to\n",
      "remove from him much of the dross of flesh and the too animal-like\n",
      "vigor that lured her while she detested it. Sometimes, when with her,\n",
      "she noted an unusual brightness in his eyes, and she admired it, for it\n",
      "made him appear more the poet and the scholar—the things he would have\n",
      "liked to be and which she would have liked him to be. But Maria Silva\n",
      "read a different tale in the hollow cheeks and the burning eyes, and\n",
      "she noted the changes in them from day to day, by them following the\n",
      "ebb and flow of his fortunes. She saw him leave the house with his\n",
      "overcoat and return without it, though the day was chill and raw, and\n",
      "promptly she saw his cheeks fill out slightly and the fire of hunger\n",
      "leave his eyes. In the same way she had seen his wheel and watch go,\n",
      "and after each event she had seen his vigor bloom again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise she watched his toils, and knew the measure of the midnight\n",
      "oil he burned. Work! She knew that he outdid her, though his work was\n",
      "of a different order. And she was surprised to behold that the less\n",
      "food he had, the harder he worked. On occasion, in a casual sort of\n",
      "way, when she thought hunger pinched hardest, she would send him in a\n",
      "loaf of new baking, awkwardly covering the act with banter to the\n",
      "effect that it was better than he could bake. And again, she would send\n",
      "one of her toddlers in to him with a great pitcher of hot soup,\n",
      "debating inwardly the while whether she was justified in taking it from\n",
      "the mouths of her own flesh and blood. Nor was Martin ungrateful,\n",
      "knowing as he did the lives of the poor, and that if ever in the world\n",
      "there was charity, this was it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a day when she had filled her brood with what was left in the house,\n",
      "Maria invested her last fifteen cents in a gallon of cheap wine.\n",
      "Martin, coming into her kitchen to fetch water, was invited to sit down\n",
      "and drink. He drank her very-good health, and in return she drank his.\n",
      "Then she drank to prosperity in his undertakings, and he drank to the\n",
      "hope that James Grant would show up and pay her for his washing. James\n",
      "Grant was a journeymen carpenter who did not always pay his bills and\n",
      "who owed Maria three dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Maria and Martin drank the sour new wine on empty stomachs, and it\n",
      "went swiftly to their heads. Utterly differentiated creatures that they\n",
      "were, they were lonely in their misery, and though the misery was\n",
      "tacitly ignored, it was the bond that drew them together. Maria was\n",
      "amazed to learn that he had been in the Azores, where she had lived\n",
      "until she was eleven. She was doubly amazed that he had been in the\n",
      "Hawaiian Islands, whither she had migrated from the Azores with her\n",
      "people. But her amazement passed all bounds when he told her he had\n",
      "been on Maui, the particular island whereon she had attained womanhood\n",
      "and married. Kahului, where she had first met her husband,—he, Martin,\n",
      "had been there twice! Yes, she remembered the sugar steamers, and he\n",
      "had been on them—well, well, it was a small world. And Wailuku! That\n",
      "place, too! Did he know the head-luna of the plantation? Yes, and had\n",
      "had a couple of drinks with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so they reminiscenced and drowned their hunger in the raw, sour\n",
      "wine. To Martin the future did not seem so dim. Success trembled just\n",
      "before him. He was on the verge of clasping it. Then he studied the\n",
      "deep-lined face of the toil-worn woman before him, remembered her soups\n",
      "and loaves of new baking, and felt spring up in him the warmest\n",
      "gratitude and philanthropy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maria,” he exclaimed suddenly. “What would you like to have?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him, bepuzzled.\n",

      "“What would you like to have now, right now, if you could get it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shoe alla da roun’ for da childs—seven pairs da shoe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall have them,” he announced, while she nodded her head gravely.\n",
      "“But I mean a big wish, something big that you want.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her eyes sparkled good-naturedly. He was choosing to make fun with her,\n",
      "Maria, with whom few made fun these days.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Think hard,” he cautioned, just as she was opening her mouth to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alla right,” she answered. “I thinka da hard. I lika da house, dis\n",
      "house—all mine, no paya da rent, seven dollar da month.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall have it,” he granted, “and in a short time. Now wish the\n",
      "great wish. Make believe I am God, and I say to you anything you want\n",
      "you can have. Then you wish that thing, and I listen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Maria considered solemnly for a space.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You no ’fraid?” she asked warningly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” he laughed, “I’m not afraid. Go ahead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most verra big,” she warned again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right. Fire away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, den—” She drew a big breath like a child, as she voiced to the\n",
      "uttermost all she cared to demand of life. “I lika da have one milka\n",
      "ranch—good milka ranch. Plenty cow, plenty land, plenty grass. I lika\n",
      "da have near San Le-an; my sister liva dere. I sella da milk in\n",

      "to school. Bimeby maka da good engineer, worka da railroad. Yes, I lika\n",

      "\n",
      "She paused and regarded Martin with twinkling eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall have it,” he answered promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "She nodded her head and touched her lips courteously to the wine-glass\n",
      "and to the giver of the gift she knew would never be given. His heart\n",
      "was right, and in her own heart she appreciated his intention as much\n",
      "as if the gift had gone with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Maria,” he went on; “Nick and Joe won’t have to peddle milk, and\n",
      "all the kids can go to school and wear shoes the whole year round. It\n",
      "will be a first-class milk ranch—everything complete. There will be a\n",
      "house to live in and a stable for the horses, and cow-barns, of course.\n",
      "There will be chickens, pigs, vegetables, fruit trees, and everything\n",
      "like that; and there will be enough cows to pay for a hired man or two.\n",
      "Then you won’t have anything to do but take care of the children. For\n",
      "that matter, if you find a good man, you can marry and take it easy\n",
      "while he runs the ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And from such largess, dispensed from his future, Martin turned and\n",
      "took his one good suit of clothes to the pawnshop. His plight was\n",
      "desperate for him to do this, for it cut him off from Ruth. He had no\n",
      "second-best suit that was presentable, and though he could go to the\n",
      "butcher and the baker, and even on occasion to his sister’s, it was\n",
      "beyond all daring to dream of entering the Morse home so disreputably\n",
      "apparelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "He toiled on, miserable and well-nigh hopeless. It began to appear to\n",
      "him that the second battle was lost and that he would have to go to\n",
      "work. In doing this he would satisfy everybody—the grocer, his sister,\n",
      "Ruth, and even Maria, to whom he owed a month’s room rent. He was two\n",
      "months behind with his type-writer, and the agency was clamoring for\n",
      "payment or for the return of the machine. In desperation, all but ready\n",
      "to surrender, to make a truce with fate until he could get a fresh\n",
      "start, he took the civil service examinations for the Railway Mail. To\n",

      "Well, he had taken the bait, the newspaper lies about writers and their\n",

      "thought of going to work reminded him of Joe—Joe, tramping through the\n",

      "of nineteen hours a day for many days was strong upon him. But then,\n",
      "Joe was not in love, had none of the responsibilities of love, and he\n",
      "could afford to loaf through the land of nothing-to-do. He, Martin, had\n",

      "it, were uppermost in his thoughts; and under his closed eyelids, in\n",
      "fiery figures, burned the “$3.85” he owed the grocer. He shivered, and\n",
      "was aware of an aching in his bones. The small of his back ached\n",
      "especially. His head ached, the top of it ached, the back of it ached,\n",
      "the brains inside of it ached and seemed to be swelling, while the ache\n",
      "over his brows was intolerable. And beneath the brows, planted under\n",
      "his lids, was the merciless “$3.85.” He opened his eyes to escape it,\n",
      "but the white light of the room seemed to sear the balls and forced him\n",
      "to close his eyes, when the “$3.85” confronted him again.\n",

      "Five dollars for five thousand words, ten words for a cent—that\n",
      "particular thought took up its residence in his brain, and he could no\n",

      "seemed to come over the latter, and he watched curiously, till “$2.00”\n",
      "burned in its stead. Ah, he thought, that was the baker. The next sum\n",
      "that appeared was “$2.50.” It puzzled him, and he pondered it as if\n",
      "life and death hung on the solution. He owed somebody two dollars and a\n",
      "half, that was certain, but who was it? To find it was the task set him\n",
      "by an imperious and malignant universe, and he wandered through the\n",
      "endless corridors of his mind, opening all manner of lumber rooms and\n",
      "chambers stored with odds and ends of memories and knowledge as he\n",
      "vainly sought the answer. After several centuries it came to him,\n",
      "easily, without effort, that it was Maria. With a great relief he\n",
      "turned his soul to the screen of torment under his lids. He had solved\n",
      "the problem; now he could rest. But no, the “$2.50” faded away, and in\n",
      "its place burned “$8.00.” Who was that? He must go the dreary round of\n",
      "his mind again and find out.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long he was gone on this quest he did not know, but after what\n",
      "seemed an enormous lapse of time, he was called back to himself by a\n",
      "knock at the door, and by Maria’s asking if he was sick. He replied in\n",
      "a muffled voice he did not recognize, saying that he was merely taking\n",
      "a nap. He was surprised when he noted the darkness of night in the\n",
      "room. He had received the letter at two in the afternoon, and he\n",
      "realized that he was sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the “$8.00” began to smoulder under his lids again, and he\n",
      "returned himself to servitude. But he grew cunning. There was no need\n",
      "for him to wander through his mind. He had been a fool. He pulled a\n",
      "lever and made his mind revolve about him, a monstrous wheel of\n",
      "fortune, a merry-go-round of memory, a revolving sphere of wisdom.\n",
      "Faster and faster it revolved, until its vortex sucked him in and he\n",
      "was flung whirling through black chaos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite naturally he found himself at a mangle, feeding starched cuffs.\n",
      "But as he fed he noticed figures printed in the cuffs. It was a new way\n",
      "of marking linen, he thought, until, looking closer, he saw “$3.85” on\n",
      "one of the cuffs. Then it came to him that it was the grocer’s bill,\n",
      "and that these were his bills flying around on the drum of the mangle.\n",
      "A crafty idea came to him. He would throw the bills on the floor and so\n",
      "escape paying them. No sooner thought than done, and he crumpled the\n",
      "cuffs spitefully as he flung them upon an unusually dirty floor. Ever\n",
      "the heap grew, and though each bill was duplicated a thousand times, he\n",
      "found only one for two dollars and a half, which was what he owed\n",
      "Maria. That meant that Maria would not press for payment, and he\n",
      "resolved generously that it would be the only one he would pay; so he\n",
      "began searching through the cast-out heap for hers. He sought it\n",
      "desperately, for ages, and was still searching when the manager of the\n",
      "hotel entered, the fat Dutchman. His face blazed with wrath, and he\n",
      "shouted in stentorian tones that echoed down the universe, “I shall\n",
      "deduct the cost of those cuffs from your wages!” The pile of cuffs grew\n",
      "into a mountain, and Martin knew that he was doomed to toil for a\n",
      "thousand years to pay for them. Well, there was nothing left to do but\n",
      "kill the manager and burn down the laundry. But the big Dutchman\n",
      "frustrated him, seizing him by the nape of the neck and dancing him up\n",
      "and down. He danced him over the ironing tables, the stove, and the\n",
      "mangles, and out into the wash-room and over the wringer and washer.\n",
      "Martin was danced until his teeth rattled and his head ached, and he\n",
      "marvelled that the Dutchman was so strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he found himself before the mangle, this time receiving the\n",
      "cuffs an editor of a magazine was feeding from the other side. Each\n",
      "cuff was a check, and Martin went over them anxiously, in a fever of\n",
      "expectation, but they were all blanks. He stood there and received the\n",
      "blanks for a million years or so, never letting one go by for fear it\n",
      "might be filled out. At last he found it. With trembling fingers he\n",
      "held it to the light. It was for five dollars. “Ha! Ha!” laughed the\n",
      "editor across the mangle. “Well, then, I shall kill you,” Martin said.\n",
      "He went out into the wash-room to get the axe, and found Joe starching\n",
      "manuscripts. He tried to make him desist, then swung the axe for him.\n",
      "But the weapon remained poised in mid-air, for Martin found himself\n",
      "back in the ironing room in the midst of a snow-storm. No, it was not\n",
      "snow that was falling, but checks of large denomination, the smallest\n",
      "not less than a thousand dollars. He began to collect them and sort\n",
      "them out, in packages of a hundred, tying each package securely with\n",
      "twine.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked up from his task and saw Joe standing before him juggling\n",
      "flat-irons, starched shirts, and manuscripts. Now and again he reached\n",
      "out and added a bundle of checks to the flying miscellany that soared\n",
      "through the roof and out of sight in a tremendous circle. Martin struck\n",
      "at him, but he seized the axe and added it to the flying circle. Then\n",
      "he plucked Martin and added him. Martin went up through the roof,\n",
      "clutching at manuscripts, so that by the time he came down he had a\n",
      "large armful. But no sooner down than up again, and a second and a\n",
      "third time and countless times he flew around the circle. From far off\n",
      "he could hear a childish treble singing: “Waltz me around again,\n",
      "Willie, around, around, around.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He recovered the axe in the midst of the Milky Way of checks, starched\n",
      "shirts, and manuscripts, and prepared, when he came down, to kill Joe.\n",
      "But he did not come down. Instead, at two in the morning, Maria, having\n",
      "heard his groans through the thin partition, came into his room, to put\n",

      "Martin Eden did not go out to hunt for a job in the morning. It was\n",
      "late afternoon before he came out of his delirium and gazed with aching\n",
      "eyes about the room. Mary, one of the tribe of Silva, eight years old,\n",
      "keeping watch, raised a screech at sight of his returning\n",
      "consciousness. Maria hurried into the room from the kitchen. She put\n",
      "her work-calloused hand upon his hot forehead and felt his pulse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You lika da eat?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head. Eating was farthest from his desire, and he wondered\n",
      "that he should ever have been hungry in his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sick, Maria,” he said weakly. “What is it? Do you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Grip,” she answered. “Two or three days you alla da right. Better you\n",

      "Martin was not used to sickness, and when Maria and her little girl\n",
      "left him, he essayed to get up and dress. By a supreme exertion of\n",
      "will, with rearing brain and eyes that ached so that he could not keep\n",
      "them open, he managed to get out of bed, only to be left stranded by\n",
      "his senses upon the table. Half an hour later he managed to regain the\n",
      "bed, where he was content to lie with closed eyes and analyze his\n",
      "various pains and weaknesses. Maria came in several times to change the\n",
      "cold cloths on his forehead. Otherwise she left him in peace, too wise\n",
      "to vex him with chatter. This moved him to gratitude, and he murmured\n",
      "to himself, “Maria, you getta da milka ranch, all righta, all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he remembered his long-buried past of yesterday.\n",

      "It seemed a life-time since he had received that letter from the\n",
      "_Transcontinental_, a life-time since it was all over and done with and\n",
      "a new page turned. He had shot his bolt, and shot it hard, and now he\n",
      "was down on his back. If he hadn’t starved himself, he wouldn’t have\n",
      "been caught by La Grippe. He had been run down, and he had not had the\n",
      "strength to throw off the germ of disease which had invaded his system.\n",
      "This was what resulted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What does it profit a man to write a whole library and lose his own\n",

      "the little home with Ruth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days later, having eaten an egg and two slices of toast and drunk a\n",
      "cup of tea, he asked for his mail, but found his eyes still hurt too\n",

      "\n",

      "“No can,” was the answer. “Teresa, she go to school, she can.”\n",

      "He read the letter through again and again. The editor told him plainly\n",
      "that he had not handled the idea properly, but that it was the idea\n",
      "they were buying because it was original. If they could cut the story\n",
      "down one-third, they would take it and send him forty dollars on\n",
      "receipt of his answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He called for pen and ink, and told the editor he could cut the story\n",

      "along.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter despatched to the letter-box by Teresa, Martin lay back and\n",
      "thought. It wasn’t a lie, after all. The _White Mouse_ paid on\n",
      "acceptance. There were three thousand words in “The Whirlpool.” Cut\n",
      "down a third, there would be two thousand. At forty dollars that would\n",
      "be two cents a word. Pay on acceptance and two cents a word—the\n",
      "newspapers had told the truth. And he had thought the _White Mouse_ a\n",
      "third-rater! It was evident that he did not know the magazines. He had\n",
      "deemed the _Transcontinental_ a first-rater, and it paid a cent for ten\n",
      "words. He had classed the _White Mouse_ as of no account, and it paid\n",
      "twenty times as much as the_ Transcontinental_ and also had paid on\n",
      "acceptance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, there was one thing certain: when he got well, he would not go\n",
      "out looking for a job. There were more stories in his head as good as\n",
      "“The Whirlpool,” and at forty dollars apiece he could earn far more\n",
      "than in any job or position. Just when he thought the battle lost, it\n",
      "was won. He had proved for his career. The way was clear. Beginning\n",
      "with the _White Mouse_ he would add magazine after magazine to his\n",
      "growing list of patrons. Hack-work could be put aside. For that matter,\n",
      "it had been wasted time, for it had not brought him a dollar. He would\n",
      "devote himself to work, good work, and he would pour out the best that\n",
      "was in him. He wished Ruth was there to share in his joy, and when he\n",
      "went over the letters left lying on his bed, he found one from her. It\n",
      "was sweetly reproachful, wondering what had kept him away for so\n",
      "dreadful a length of time. He reread the letter adoringly, dwelling\n",
      "over her handwriting, loving each stroke of her pen, and in the end\n",
      "kissing her signature.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he answered, he told her recklessly that he had not been to\n",
      "see her because his best clothes were in pawn. He told her that he had\n",
      "been sick, but was once more nearly well, and that inside ten days or\n",
      "two weeks (as soon as a letter could travel to New York City and\n",
      "return) he would redeem his clothes and be with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Ruth did not care to wait ten days or two weeks. Besides, her lover\n",
      "was sick. The next afternoon, accompanied by Arthur, she arrived in the\n",
      "Morse carriage, to the unqualified delight of the Silva tribe and of\n",
      "all the urchins on the street, and to the consternation of Maria. She\n",
      "boxed the ears of the Silvas who crowded about the visitors on the tiny\n",
      "front porch, and in more than usual atrocious English tried to\n",
      "apologize for her appearance. Sleeves rolled up from soap-flecked arms\n",
      "and a wet gunny-sack around her waist told of the task at which she had\n",
      "been caught. So flustered was she by two such grand young people asking\n",
      "for her lodger, that she forgot to invite them to sit down in the\n",
      "little parlor. To enter Martin’s room, they passed through the kitchen,\n",
      "warm and moist and steamy from the big washing in progress. Maria, in\n",
      "her excitement, jammed the bedroom and bedroom-closet doors together,\n",
      "and for five minutes, through the partly open door, clouds of steam,\n",
      "smelling of soap-suds and dirt, poured into the sick chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth succeeded in veering right and left and right again, and in\n",
      "running the narrow passage between table and bed to Martin’s side; but\n",
      "Arthur veered too wide and fetched up with clatter and bang of pots and\n",
      "pans in the corner where Martin did his cooking. Arthur did not linger\n",
      "long. Ruth occupied the only chair, and having done his duty, he went\n",
      "outside and stood by the gate, the centre of seven marvelling Silvas,\n",
      "who watched him as they would have watched a curiosity in a side-show.\n",
      "All about the carriage were gathered the children from a dozen blocks,\n",
      "waiting and eager for some tragic and terrible dénouement. Carriages\n",
      "were seen on their street only for weddings and funerals. Here was\n",
      "neither marriage nor death: therefore, it was something transcending\n",
      "experience and well worth waiting for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin had been wild to see Ruth. His was essentially a love-nature,\n",
      "and he possessed more than the average man’s need for sympathy. He was\n",
      "starving for sympathy, which, with him, meant intelligent\n",
      "understanding; and he had yet to learn that Ruth’s sympathy was largely\n",
      "sentimental and tactful, and that it proceeded from gentleness of\n",
      "nature rather than from understanding of the objects of her sympathy.\n",
      "So it was while Martin held her hand and gladly talked, that her love\n",
      "for him prompted her to press his hand in return, and that her eyes\n",
      "were moist and luminous at sight of his helplessness and of the marks\n",
      "suffering had stamped upon his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while he told her of his two acceptances, of his despair when he\n",
      "received the one from the _Transcontinental_, and of the corresponding\n",
      "delight with which he received the one from the _White Mouse_, she did\n",
      "not follow him. She heard the words he uttered and understood their\n",
      "literal import, but she was not with him in his despair and his\n",
      "delight. She could not get out of herself. She was not interested in\n",
      "selling stories to magazines. What was important to her was matrimony.\n",
      "She was not aware of it, however, any more than she was aware that her\n",
      "desire that Martin take a position was the instinctive and preparative\n",
      "impulse of motherhood. She would have blushed had she been told as much\n",
      "in plain, set terms, and next, she might have grown indignant and\n",
      "asserted that her sole interest lay in the man she loved and her desire\n",
      "for him to make the best of himself. So, while Martin poured out his\n",
      "heart to her, elated with the first success his chosen work in the\n",
      "world had received, she paid heed to his bare words only, gazing now\n",
      "and again about the room, shocked by what she saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time Ruth gazed upon the sordid face of poverty. Starving\n",
      "lovers had always seemed romantic to her,—but she had had no idea how\n",
      "starving lovers lived. She had never dreamed it could be like this.\n",
      "Ever her gaze shifted from the room to him and back again. The steamy\n",
      "smell of dirty clothes, which had entered with her from the kitchen,\n",
      "was sickening. Martin must be soaked with it, Ruth concluded, if that\n",
      "awful woman washed frequently. Such was the contagiousness of\n",
      "degradation. When she looked at Martin, she seemed to see the smirch\n",
      "left upon him by his surroundings. She had never seen him unshaven, and\n",
      "the three days’ growth of beard on his face was repulsive to her. Not\n",
      "alone did it give him the same dark and murky aspect of the Silva\n",
      "house, inside and out, but it seemed to emphasize that animal-like\n",
      "strength of his which she detested. And here he was, being confirmed in\n",
      "his madness by the two acceptances he took such pride in telling her\n",
      "about. A little longer and he would have surrendered and gone to work.\n",
      "Now he would continue on in this horrible house, writing and starving\n",
      "for a few more months.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that smell?” she asked suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some of Maria’s washing smells, I imagine,” was the answer. “I am\n",
      "growing quite accustomed to them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no; not that. It is something else. A stale, sickish smell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin sampled the air before replying.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t smell anything else, except stale tobacco smoke,” he\n",
      "announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s it. It is terrible. Why do you smoke so much, Martin?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know, except that I smoke more than usual when I am lonely.\n",
      "And then, too, it’s such a long-standing habit. I learned when I was\n",
      "only a youngster.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not a nice habit, you know,” she reproved. “It smells to\n",
      "heaven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the fault of the tobacco. I can afford only the cheapest. But\n",
      "wait until I get that forty-dollar check. I’ll use a brand that is not\n",
      "offensive even to the angels. But that wasn’t so bad, was it, two\n",
      "acceptances in three days? That forty-five dollars will pay about all\n",
      "my debts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For two years’ work?” she queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, for less than a week’s work. Please pass me that book over on the\n",
      "far corner of the table, the account book with the gray cover.” He\n",
      "opened it and began turning over the pages rapidly. “Yes, I was right.\n",
      "Four days for ‘The Ring of Bells,’ two days for ‘The Whirlpool.’ That’s\n",
      "forty-five dollars for a week’s work, one hundred and eighty dollars a\n",
      "month. That beats any salary I can command. And, besides, I’m just\n",
      "beginning. A thousand dollars a month is not too much to buy for you\n",
      "all I want you to have. A salary of five hundred a month would be too\n",
      "small. That forty-five dollars is just a starter. Wait till I get my\n",
      "stride. Then watch my smoke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth misunderstood his slang, and reverted to cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You smoke more than enough as it is, and the brand of tobacco will\n",
      "make no difference. It is the smoking itself that is not nice, no\n",
      "matter what the brand may be. You are a chimney, a living volcano, a\n",
      "perambulating smoke-stack, and you are a perfect disgrace, Martin dear,\n",
      "you know you are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She leaned toward him, entreaty in her eyes, and as he looked at her\n",
      "delicate face and into her pure, limpid eyes, as of old he was struck\n",
      "with his own unworthiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish you wouldn’t smoke any more,” she whispered. “Please, for—my\n",

      "\n",
      "A great temptation assailed her. In an insistent way she had caught\n",
      "glimpses of the large, easy-going side of his nature, and she felt\n",
      "sure, if she asked him to cease attempting to write, that he would\n",
      "grant her wish. In the swift instant that elapsed, the words trembled\n",
      "on her lips. But she did not utter them. She was not quite brave\n",
      "enough; she did not quite dare. Instead, she leaned toward him to meet\n",
      "him, and in his arms murmured:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know, it is really not for my sake, Martin, but for your own. I am\n",
      "sure smoking hurts you; and besides, it is not good to be a slave to\n",
      "anything, to a drug least of all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall always be your slave,” he smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In which case, I shall begin issuing my commands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him mischievously, though deep down she was already\n",

      "\n",
      "“I live but to obey, your majesty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, my first commandment is, Thou shalt not omit to shave\n",
      "every day. Look how you have scratched my cheek.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so it ended in caresses and love-laughter. But she had made one\n",
      "point, and she could not expect to make more than one at a time. She\n",
      "felt a woman’s pride in that she had made him stop smoking. Another\n",
      "time she would persuade him to take a position, for had he not said he\n",
      "would do anything she asked?\n",
      "\n",
      "She left his side to explore the room, examining the clothes-lines of\n",
      "notes overhead, learning the mystery of the tackle used for suspending\n",
      "his wheel under the ceiling, and being saddened by the heap of\n",
      "manuscripts under the table which represented to her just so much\n",
      "wasted time. The oil-stove won her admiration, but on investigating the\n",
      "food shelves she found them empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, you haven’t anything to eat, you poor dear,” she said with tender\n",
      "compassion. “You must be starving.”\n",

      "She had come back to his side, and she saw him double his arm at the\n",
      "elbow, the biceps crawling under his shirt-sleeve and swelling into a\n",
      "knot of muscle, heavy and hard. The sight repelled her. Sentimentally,\n",
      "she disliked it. But her pulse, her blood, every fibre of her, loved it\n",
      "and yearned for it, and, in the old, inexplicable way, she leaned\n",
      "toward him, not away from him. And in the moment that followed, when he\n",
      "crushed her in his arms, the brain of her, concerned with the\n",
      "superficial aspects of life, was in revolt; while the heart of her, the\n",
      "woman of her, concerned with life itself, exulted triumphantly. It was\n",
      "in moments like this that she felt to the uttermost the greatness of\n",
      "her love for Martin, for it was almost a swoon of delight to her to\n",
      "feel his strong arms about her, holding her tightly, hurting her with\n",
      "the grip of their fervor. At such moments she found justification for\n",
      "her treason to her standards, for her violation of her own high ideals,\n",
      "and, most of all, for her tacit disobedience to her mother and father.\n",
      "They did not want her to marry this man. It shocked them that she\n",
      "should love him. It shocked her, too, sometimes, when she was apart\n",
      "from him, a cool and reasoning creature. With him, she loved him—in\n",
      "truth, at times a vexed and worried love; but love it was, a love that\n",
      "was stronger than she.\n",

      "\n",
      "Such royal carelessness of body seemed criminal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I didn’t know,” he answered. “I never dreamed of lepers. When\n",
      "I deserted the schooner and landed on the beach, I headed inland for\n",
      "some place of hiding. For three days I lived off guavas, _ohia_-apples,\n",
      "and bananas, all of which grew wild in the jungle. On the fourth day I\n",
      "found the trail—a mere foot-trail. It led inland, and it led up. It was\n",
      "the way I wanted to go, and it showed signs of recent travel. At one\n",
      "place it ran along the crest of a ridge that was no more than a\n",
      "knife-edge. The trail wasn’t three feet wide on the crest, and on\n",
      "either side the ridge fell away in precipices hundreds of feet deep.\n",
      "One man, with plenty of ammunition, could have held it against a\n",
      "hundred thousand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was the only way in to the hiding-place. Three hours after I found\n",
      "the trail I was there, in a little mountain valley, a pocket in the\n",
      "midst of lava peaks. The whole place was terraced for taro-patches,\n",
      "fruit trees grew there, and there were eight or ten grass huts. But as\n",
      "soon as I saw the inhabitants I knew what I’d struck. One sight of them\n",
      "was enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you do?” Ruth demanded breathlessly, listening, like any\n",
      "Desdemona, appalled and fascinated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing for me to do. Their leader was a kind old fellow, pretty far\n",
      "gone, but he ruled like a king. He had discovered the little valley and\n",
      "founded the settlement—all of which was against the law. But he had\n",
      "guns, plenty of ammunition, and those Kanakas, trained to the shooting\n",
      "of wild cattle and wild pig, were dead shots. No, there wasn’t any\n",
      "running away for Martin Eden. He stayed—for three months.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how did you escape?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d have been there yet, if it hadn’t been for a girl there, a\n",
      "half-Chinese, quarter-white, and quarter-Hawaiian. She was a beauty,\n",
      "poor thing, and well educated. Her mother, in Honolulu, was worth a\n",
      "million or so. Well, this girl got me away at last. Her mother financed\n",
      "the settlement, you see, so the girl wasn’t afraid of being punished\n",
      "for letting me go. But she made me swear, first, never to reveal the\n",
      "hiding-place; and I never have. This is the first time I have even\n",
      "mentioned it. The girl had just the first signs of leprosy. The fingers\n",
      "of her right hand were slightly twisted, and there was a small spot on\n",
      "her arm. That was all. I guess she is dead, now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But weren’t you frightened? And weren’t you glad to get away without\n",
      "catching that dreadful disease?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” he confessed, “I was a bit shivery at first; but I got used to\n",
      "it. I used to feel sorry for that poor girl, though. That made me\n",
      "forget to be afraid. She was such a beauty, in spirit as well as in\n",
      "appearance, and she was only slightly touched; yet she was doomed to\n",
      "lie there, living the life of a primitive savage and rotting slowly\n",
      "away. Leprosy is far more terrible than you can imagine it.”\n",
      "\n",

      "away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you mean?” Martin asked unwittingly.\n",
      "\n",

      "now, didn’t she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin’s sunburn had been bleached by his work in the laundry and by\n",
      "the indoor life he was living, while the hunger and the sickness had\n",
      "made his face even pale; and across this pallor flowed the slow wave of\n",
      "a blush. He was opening his mouth to speak, but Ruth shut him off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind, don’t answer; it’s not necessary,” she laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it seemed to him there was something metallic in her laughter, and\n",
      "that the light in her eyes was cold. On the spur of the moment it\n",
      "reminded him of a gale he had once experienced in the North Pacific.\n",
      "And for the moment the apparition of the gale rose before his eyes—a\n",
      "gale at night, with a clear sky and under a full moon, the huge seas\n",
      "glinting coldly in the moonlight. Next, he saw the girl in the leper\n",
      "refuge and remembered it was for love of him that she had let him go.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She was noble,” he said simply. “She gave me life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was all of the incident, but he heard Ruth muffle a dry sob in her\n",
      "throat, and noticed that she turned her face away to gaze out of the\n",
      "window. When she turned it back to him, it was composed, and there was\n",
      "no hint of the gale in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m such a silly,” she said plaintively. “But I can’t help it. I do so\n",
      "love you, Martin, I do, I do. I shall grow more catholic in time, but\n",
      "at present I can’t help being jealous of those ghosts of the past, and\n",
      "you know your past is full of ghosts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must be,” she silenced his protest. “It could not be otherwise. And\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The sun of Martin’s good fortune rose. The day after Ruth’s visit, he\n",
      "received a check for three dollars from a New York scandal weekly in\n",
      "payment for three of his triolets. Two days later a newspaper published\n",
      "in Chicago accepted his “Treasure Hunters,” promising to pay ten\n",
      "dollars for it on publication. The price was small, but it was the\n",
      "first article he had written, his very first attempt to express his\n",
      "thought on the printed page. To cap everything, the adventure serial\n",
      "for boys, his second attempt, was accepted before the end of the week\n",
      "by a juvenile monthly calling itself _Youth and Age_. It was true the\n",
      "serial was twenty-one thousand words, and they offered to pay him\n",
      "sixteen dollars on publication, which was something like seventy-five\n",
      "cents a thousand words; but it was equally true that it was the second\n",
      "thing he had attempted to write and that he was himself thoroughly\n",
      "aware of its clumsy worthlessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even his earliest efforts were not marked with the clumsiness of\n",
      "mediocrity. What characterized them was the clumsiness of too great\n",
      "strength—the clumsiness which the tyro betrays when he crushes\n",
      "butterflies with battering rams and hammers out vignettes with a\n",
      "war-club. So it was that Martin was glad to sell his early efforts for\n",
      "songs. He knew them for what they were, and it had not taken him long\n",
      "to acquire this knowledge. What he pinned his faith to was his later\n",
      "work. He had striven to be something more than a mere writer of\n",
      "magazine fiction. He had sought to equip himself with the tools of\n",
      "artistry. On the other hand, he had not sacrificed strength. His\n",
      "conscious aim had been to increase his strength by avoiding excess of\n",
      "strength. Nor had he departed from his love of reality. His work was\n",
      "realism, though he had endeavored to fuse with it the fancies and\n",
      "beauties of imagination. What he sought was an impassioned realism,\n",
      "shot through with human aspiration and faith. What he wanted was life\n",
      "as it was, with all its spirit-groping and soul-reaching left in.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had discovered, in the course of his reading, two schools of\n",
      "fiction. One treated of man as a god, ignoring his earthly origin; the\n",
      "other treated of man as a clod, ignoring his heaven-sent dreams and\n",
      "divine possibilities. Both the god and the clod schools erred, in\n",
      "Martin’s estimation, and erred through too great singleness of sight\n",
      "and purpose. There was a compromise that approximated the truth, though\n",
      "it flattered not the school of god, while it challenged the\n",
      "brute-savageness of the school of clod. It was his story, “Adventure,”\n",
      "which had dragged with Ruth, that Martin believed had achieved his\n",
      "ideal of the true in fiction; and it was in an essay, “God and Clod,”\n",
      "that he had expressed his views on the whole general subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "But “Adventure,” and all that he deemed his best work, still went\n",
      "begging among the editors. His early work counted for nothing in his\n",
      "eyes except for the money it brought, and his horror stories, two of\n",
      "which he had sold, he did not consider high work nor his best work. To\n",
      "him they were frankly imaginative and fantastic, though invested with\n",
      "all the glamour of the real, wherein lay their power. This investiture\n",
      "of the grotesque and impossible with reality, he looked upon as a\n",
      "trick—a skilful trick at best. Great literature could not reside in\n",
      "such a field. Their artistry was high, but he denied the worthwhileness\n",
      "of artistry when divorced from humanness. The trick had been to fling\n",
      "over the face of his artistry a mask of humanness, and this he had done\n",
      "in the half-dozen or so stories of the horror brand he had written\n",
      "before he emerged upon the high peaks of “Adventure,” “Joy,” “The Pot,”\n",
      "and “The Wine of Life.”\n",

      "dollar on account and dividing the remaining two dollars between the\n",
      "baker and the fruit store. Martin was not yet rich enough to afford\n",
      "meat, and he was on slim allowance when the _White Mouse_ check\n",
      "arrived. He was divided on the cashing of it. He had never been in a\n",

      "and childlike desire to walk into one of the big banks down in Oakland\n",
      "and fling down his indorsed check for forty dollars. On the other hand,\n",
      "practical common sense ruled that he should cash it with his grocer and\n",
      "thereby make an impression that would later result in an increase of\n",
      "credit. Reluctantly Martin yielded to the claims of the grocer, paying\n",
      "his bill with him in full, and receiving in change a pocketful of\n",
      "jingling coin. Also, he paid the other tradesmen in full, redeemed his\n",
      "suit and his bicycle, paid one month’s rent on the type-writer, and\n",
      "paid Maria the overdue month for his room and a month in advance. This\n",
      "left him in his pocket, for emergencies, a balance of nearly three\n",
      "dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "In itself, this small sum seemed a fortune. Immediately on recovering\n",
      "his clothes he had gone to see Ruth, and on the way he could not\n",
      "refrain from jingling the little handful of silver in his pocket. He\n",
      "had been so long without money that, like a rescued starving man who\n",
      "cannot let the unconsumed food out of his sight, Martin could not keep\n",
      "his hand off the silver. He was not mean, nor avaricious, but the money\n",
      "meant more than so many dollars and cents. It stood for success, and\n",
      "the eagles stamped upon the coins were to him so many winged victories.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to him insensibly that it was a very good world. It certainly\n",
      "appeared more beautiful to him. For weeks it had been a very dull and\n",
      "sombre world; but now, with nearly all debts paid, three dollars\n",
      "jingling in his pocket, and in his mind the consciousness of success,\n",
      "the sun shone bright and warm, and even a rain-squall that soaked\n",
      "unprepared pedestrians seemed a merry happening to him. When he\n",
      "starved, his thoughts had dwelt often upon the thousands he knew were\n",
      "starving the world over; but now that he was feasted full, the fact of\n",
      "the thousands starving was no longer pregnant in his brain. He forgot\n",
      "about them, and, being in love, remembered the countless lovers in the\n",
      "world. Without deliberately thinking about it, _motifs_ for love-lyrics\n",
      "began to agitate his brain. Swept away by the creative impulse, he got\n",
      "off the electric car, without vexation, two blocks beyond his crossing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found a number of persons in the Morse home. Ruth’s two girl-cousins\n",
      "were visiting her from San Rafael, and Mrs. Morse, under pretext of\n",
      "entertaining them, was pursuing her plan of surrounding Ruth with young\n",
      "people. The campaign had begun during Martin’s enforced absence, and\n",
      "was already in full swing. She was making a point of having at the\n",
      "house men who were doing things. Thus, in addition to the cousins\n",
      "Dorothy and Florence, Martin encountered two university professors, one\n",
      "of Latin, the other of English; a young army officer just back from the\n",
      "Philippines, one-time school-mate of Ruth’s; a young fellow named\n",
      "Melville, private secretary to Joseph Perkins, head of the San\n",
      "Francisco Trust Company; and finally of the men, a live bank cashier,\n",
      "Charles Hapgood, a youngish man of thirty-five, graduate of Stanford\n",
      "University, member of the Nile Club and the Unity Club, and a\n",
      "conservative speaker for the Republican Party during campaigns—in\n",
      "short, a rising young man in every way. Among the women was one who\n",
      "painted portraits, another who was a professional musician, and still\n",
      "another who possessed the degree of Doctor of Sociology and who was\n",
      "locally famous for her social settlement work in the slums of San\n",
      "Francisco. But the women did not count for much in Mrs. Morse’s plan.\n",
      "At the best, they were necessary accessories. The men who did things\n",
      "must be drawn to the house somehow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t get excited when you talk,” Ruth admonished Martin, before the\n",
      "ordeal of introduction began.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bore himself a bit stiffly at first, oppressed by a sense of his own\n",
      "awkwardness, especially of his shoulders, which were up to their old\n",
      "trick of threatening destruction to furniture and ornaments. Also, he\n",
      "was rendered self-conscious by the company. He had never before been in\n",
      "contact with such exalted beings nor with so many of them. Melville,\n",
      "the bank cashier, fascinated him, and he resolved to investigate him at\n",
      "the first opportunity. For underneath Martin’s awe lurked his assertive\n",
      "ego, and he felt the urge to measure himself with these men and women\n",
      "and to find out what they had learned from the books and life which he\n",
      "had not learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth’s eyes roved to him frequently to see how he was getting on, and\n",
      "she was surprised and gladdened by the ease with which he got\n",
      "acquainted with her cousins. He certainly did not grow excited, while\n",
      "being seated removed from him the worry of his shoulders. Ruth knew\n",
      "them for clever girls, superficially brilliant, and she could scarcely\n",
      "understand their praise of Martin later that night at going to bed. But\n",
      "he, on the other hand, a wit in his own class, a gay quizzer and\n",
      "laughter-maker at dances and Sunday picnics, had found the making of\n",
      "fun and the breaking of good-natured lances simple enough in this\n",
      "environment. And on this evening success stood at his back, patting him\n",
      "on the shoulder and telling him that he was making good, so that he\n",
      "could afford to laugh and make laughter and remain unabashed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, Ruth’s anxiety found justification. Martin and Professor\n",
      "Caldwell had got together in a conspicuous corner, and though Martin no\n",
      "longer wove the air with his hands, to Ruth’s critical eye he permitted\n",
      "his own eyes to flash and glitter too frequently, talked too rapidly\n",
      "and warmly, grew too intense, and allowed his aroused blood to redden\n",
      "his cheeks too much. He lacked decorum and control, and was in decided\n",
      "contrast to the young professor of English with whom he talked.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Martin was not concerned with appearances! He had been swift to\n",
      "note the other’s trained mind and to appreciate his command of\n",
      "knowledge. Furthermore, Professor Caldwell did not realize Martin’s\n",
      "concept of the average English professor. Martin wanted him to talk\n",
      "shop, and, though he seemed averse at first, succeeded in making him do\n",
      "it. For Martin did not see why a man should not talk shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s absurd and unfair,” he had told Ruth weeks before, “this\n",
      "objection to talking shop. For what reason under the sun do men and\n",
      "women come together if not for the exchange of the best that is in\n",
      "them? And the best that is in them is what they are interested in, the\n",
      "thing by which they make their living, the thing they’ve specialized on\n",
      "and sat up days and nights over, and even dreamed about. Imagine Mr.\n",
      "Butler living up to social etiquette and enunciating his views on Paul\n",
      "Verlaine or the German drama or the novels of D’Annunzio. We’d be bored\n",
      "to death. I, for one, if I must listen to Mr. Butler, prefer to hear\n",
      "him talk about his law. It’s the best that is in him, and life is so\n",
      "short that I want the best of every man and woman I meet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But,” Ruth had objected, “there are the topics of general interest to\n",
      "all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, you mistake,” he had rushed on. “All persons in society, all\n",
      "cliques in society—or, rather, nearly all persons and cliques—ape their\n",
      "betters. Now, who are the best betters? The idlers, the wealthy idlers.\n",
      "They do not know, as a rule, the things known by the persons who are\n",
      "doing something in the world. To listen to conversation about such\n",
      "things would mean to be bored, wherefore the idlers decree that such\n",
      "things are shop and must not be talked about. Likewise they decree the\n",
      "things that are not shop and which may be talked about, and those\n",
      "things are the latest operas, latest novels, cards, billiards,\n",
      "cocktails, automobiles, horse shows, trout fishing, tuna-fishing,\n",
      "big-game shooting, yacht sailing, and so forth—and mark you, these are\n",
      "the things the idlers know. In all truth, they constitute the shop-talk\n",
      "of the idlers. And the funniest part of it is that many of the clever\n",
      "people, and all the would-be clever people, allow the idlers so to\n",
      "impose upon them. As for me, I want the best a man’s got in him, call\n",
      "it shop vulgarity or anything you please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Ruth had not understood. This attack of his on the established had\n",
      "seemed to her just so much wilfulness of opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Martin contaminated Professor Caldwell with his own earnestness,\n",
      "challenging him to speak his mind. As Ruth paused beside them she heard\n",
      "Martin saying:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“You surely don’t pronounce such heresies in the University of\n",
      "California?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor Caldwell shrugged his shoulders. “The honest taxpayer and the\n",
      "politician, you know. Sacramento gives us our appropriations and\n",
      "therefore we kowtow to Sacramento, and to the Board of Regents, and to\n",
      "the party press, or to the press of both parties.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that’s clear; but how about you?” Martin urged. “You must be a\n",
      "fish out of the water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Few like me, I imagine, in the university pond. Sometimes I am fairly\n",
      "sure I am out of water, and that I should belong in Paris, in Grub\n",
      "Street, in a hermit’s cave, or in some sadly wild Bohemian crowd,\n",
      "drinking claret,—dago-red they call it in San Francisco,—dining in\n",
      "cheap restaurants in the Latin Quarter, and expressing vociferously\n",
      "radical views upon all creation. Really, I am frequently almost sure\n",
      "that I was cut out to be a radical. But then, there are so many\n",
      "questions on which I am not sure. I grow timid when I am face to face\n",
      "with my human frailty, which ever prevents me from grasping all the\n",
      "factors in any problem—human, vital problems, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And as he talked on, Martin became aware that to his own lips had come\n",
      "the “Song of the Trade Wind”:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am strongest at noon,\n",
      "But under the moon\n",
      "    I stiffen the bunt of the sail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He was almost humming the words, and it dawned upon him that the other\n",
      "reminded him of the trade wind, of the Northeast Trade, steady, and\n",
      "cool, and strong. He was equable, he was to be relied upon, and withal\n",
      "there was a certain bafflement about him. Martin had the feeling that\n",
      "he never spoke his full mind, just as he had often had the feeling that\n",
      "the trades never blew their strongest but always held reserves of\n",
      "strength that were never used. Martin’s trick of visioning was active\n",
      "as ever. His brain was a most accessible storehouse of remembered fact\n",
      "and fancy, and its contents seemed ever ordered and spread for his\n",
      "inspection. Whatever occurred in the instant present, Martin’s mind\n",
      "immediately presented associated antithesis or similitude which\n",
      "ordinarily expressed themselves to him in vision. It was sheerly\n",
      "automatic, and his visioning was an unfailing accompaniment to the\n",
      "living present. Just as Ruth’s face, in a momentary jealousy had called\n",
      "before his eyes a forgotten moonlight gale, and as Professor Caldwell\n",
      "made him see again the Northeast Trade herding the white billows across\n",
      "the purple sea, so, from moment to moment, not disconcerting but rather\n",
      "identifying and classifying, new memory-visions rose before him, or\n",
      "spread under his eyelids, or were thrown upon the screen of his\n",
      "consciousness. These visions came out of the actions and sensations of\n",
      "the past, out of things and events and books of yesterday and last\n",
      "week—a countless host of apparitions that, waking or sleeping, forever\n",
      "thronged his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it was, as he listened to Professor Caldwell’s easy flow of\n",
      "speech—the conversation of a clever, cultured man—that Martin kept\n",
      "seeing himself down all his past. He saw himself when he had been quite\n",
      "the hoodlum, wearing a “stiff-rim” Stetson hat and a square-cut,\n",
      "double-breasted coat, with a certain swagger to the shoulders and\n",
      "possessing the ideal of being as tough as the police permitted. He did\n",
      "not disguise it to himself, nor attempt to palliate it. At one time in\n",
      "his life he had been just a common hoodlum, the leader of a gang that\n",
      "worried the police and terrorized honest, working-class householders.\n",
      "But his ideals had changed. He glanced about him at the well-bred,\n",
      "well-dressed men and women, and breathed into his lungs the atmosphere\n",
      "of culture and refinement, and at the same moment the ghost of his\n",
      "early youth, in stiff-rim and square-cut, with swagger and toughness,\n",
      "stalked across the room. This figure, of the corner hoodlum, he saw\n",
      "merge into himself, sitting and talking with an actual university\n",
      "professor.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, after all, he had never found his permanent abiding place. He had\n",
      "fitted in wherever he found himself, been a favorite always and\n",
      "everywhere by virtue of holding his own at work and at play and by his\n",
      "willingness and ability to fight for his rights and command respect.\n",
      "But he had never taken root. He had fitted in sufficiently to satisfy\n",
      "his fellows but not to satisfy himself. He had been perturbed always by\n",
      "a feeling of unrest, had heard always the call of something from\n",
      "beyond, and had wandered on through life seeking it until he found\n",
      "books and art and love. And here he was, in the midst of all this, the\n",
      "only one of all the comrades he had adventured with who could have made\n",
      "themselves eligible for the inside of the Morse home.\n",
      "\n",
      "But such thoughts and visions did not prevent him from following\n",
      "Professor Caldwell closely. And as he followed, comprehendingly and\n",
      "critically, he noted the unbroken field of the other’s knowledge. As\n",
      "for himself, from moment to moment the conversation showed him gaps and\n",
      "open stretches, whole subjects with which he was unfamiliar.\n",
      "Nevertheless, thanks to his Spencer, he saw that he possessed the\n",
      "outlines of the field of knowledge. It was a matter only of time, when\n",
      "he would fill in the outline. Then watch out, he thought—’ware shoal,\n",
      "everybody! He felt like sitting at the feet of the professor,\n",
      "worshipful and absorbent; but, as he listened, he began to discern a\n",
      "weakness in the other’s judgments—a weakness so stray and elusive that\n",
      "he might not have caught it had it not been ever present. And when he\n",
      "did catch it, he leapt to equality at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth came up to them a second time, just as Martin began to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you where you are wrong, or, rather, what weakens your\n",
      "judgments,” he said. “You lack biology. It has no place in your scheme\n",
      "of things.—Oh, I mean the real interpretative biology, from the ground\n",
      "up, from the laboratory and the test-tube and the vitalized inorganic\n",
      "right on up to the widest aesthetic and sociological generalizations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth was appalled. She had sat two lecture courses under Professor\n",
      "Caldwell and looked up to him as the living repository of all\n",
      "knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I scarcely follow you,” he said dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin was not so sure but what he had followed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I’ll try to explain,” he said. “I remember reading in Egyptian\n",
      "history something to the effect that understanding could not be had of\n",
      "Egyptian art without first studying the land question.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite right,” the professor nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And it seems to me,” Martin continued, “that knowledge of the land\n",
      "question, in turn, of all questions, for that matter, cannot be had\n",
      "without previous knowledge of the stuff and the constitution of life.\n",
      "How can we understand laws and institutions, religions and customs,\n",
      "without understanding, not merely the nature of the creatures that made\n",
      "them, but the nature of the stuff out of which the creatures are made?\n",
      "Is literature less human than the architecture and sculpture of Egypt?\n",
      "Is there one thing in the known universe that is not subject to the law\n",
      "of evolution?—Oh, I know there is an elaborate evolution of the various\n",
      "arts laid down, but it seems to me to be too mechanical. The human\n",
      "himself is left out. The evolution of the tool, of the harp, of music\n",
      "and song and dance, are all beautifully elaborated; but how about the\n",
      "evolution of the human himself, the development of the basic and\n",
      "intrinsic parts that were in him before he made his first tool or\n",
      "gibbered his first chant? It is that which you do not consider, and\n",
      "which I call biology. It is biology in its largest aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know I express myself incoherently, but I’ve tried to hammer out the\n",
      "idea. It came to me as you were talking, so I was not primed and ready\n",
      "to deliver it. You spoke yourself of the human frailty that prevented\n",
      "one from taking all the factors into consideration. And you, in\n",
      "turn,—or so it seems to me,—leave out the biological factor, the very\n",
      "stuff out of which has been spun the fabric of all the arts, the warp\n",
      "and the woof of all human actions and achievements.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To Ruth’s amazement, Martin was not immediately crushed, and that the\n",
      "professor replied in the way he did struck her as forbearance for\n",
      "Martin’s youth. Professor Caldwell sat for a full minute, silent and\n",
      "fingering his watch chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know,” he said at last, “I’ve had that same criticism passed on\n",
      "me once before—by a very great man, a scientist and evolutionist,\n",
      "Joseph Le Conte. But he is dead, and I thought to remain undetected;\n",
      "and now you come along and expose me. Seriously, though—and this is\n",
      "confession—I think there is something in your contention—a great deal,\n",
      "in fact. I am too classical, not enough up-to-date in the\n",
      "interpretative branches of science, and I can only plead the\n",
      "disadvantages of my education and a temperamental slothfulness that\n",
      "prevents me from doing the work. I wonder if you’ll believe that I’ve\n",
      "never been inside a physics or chemistry laboratory? It is true,\n",
      "nevertheless. Le Conte was right, and so are you, Mr. Eden, at least to\n",
      "an extent—how much I do not know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth drew Martin away with her on a pretext; when she had got him\n",
      "aside, whispering:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shouldn’t have monopolized Professor Caldwell that way. There may\n",
      "be others who want to talk with him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My mistake,” Martin admitted contritely. “But I’d got him stirred up,\n",
      "and he was so interesting that I did not think. Do you know, he is the\n",
      "brightest, the most intellectual, man I have ever talked with. And I’ll\n",
      "tell you something else. I once thought that everybody who went to\n",
      "universities, or who sat in the high places in society, was just as\n",
      "brilliant and intelligent as he.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s an exception,” she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should say so. Whom do you want me to talk to now?—Oh, say, bring me\n",
      "up against that cashier-fellow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin talked for fifteen minutes with him, nor could Ruth have wished\n",
      "better behavior on her lover’s part. Not once did his eyes flash nor\n",
      "his cheeks flush, while the calmness and poise with which he talked\n",
      "surprised her. But in Martin’s estimation the whole tribe of bank\n",
      "cashiers fell a few hundred per cent, and for the rest of the evening\n",
      "he labored under the impression that bank cashiers and talkers of\n",
      "platitudes were synonymous phrases. The army officer he found\n",
      "good-natured and simple, a healthy, wholesome young fellow, content to\n",
      "occupy the place in life into which birth and luck had flung him. On\n",
      "learning that he had completed two years in the university, Martin was\n",
      "puzzled to know where he had stored it away. Nevertheless Martin liked\n",
      "him better than the platitudinous bank cashier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I really don’t object to platitudes,” he told Ruth later; “but what\n",
      "worries me into nervousness is the pompous, smugly complacent, superior\n",
      "certitude with which they are uttered and the time taken to do it. Why,\n",
      "I could give that man the whole history of the Reformation in the time\n",
      "he took to tell me that the Union-Labor Party had fused with the\n",
      "Democrats. Do you know, he skins his words as a professional\n",
      "poker-player skins the cards that are dealt out to him. Some day I’ll\n",
      "show you what I mean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sorry you don’t like him,” was her reply. “He’s a favorite of Mr.\n",
      "Butler’s. Mr. Butler says he is safe and honest—calls him the Rock,\n",
      "Peter, and says that upon him any banking institution can well be\n",
      "built.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t doubt it—from the little I saw of him and the less I heard\n",
      "from him; but I don’t think so much of banks as I did. You don’t mind\n",
      "my speaking my mind this way, dear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no; it is most interesting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” Martin went on heartily, “I’m no more than a barbarian getting\n",

      "But success had lost Martin’s address, and her messengers no longer\n",
      "came to his door. For twenty-five days, working Sundays and holidays,\n",
      "he toiled on “The Shame of the Sun,” a long essay of some thirty\n",
      "thousand words. It was a deliberate attack on the mysticism of the\n",
      "Maeterlinck school—an attack from the citadel of positive science upon\n",
      "the wonder-dreamers, but an attack nevertheless that retained much of\n",
      "beauty and wonder of the sort compatible with ascertained fact. It was\n",
      "a little later that he followed up the attack with two short essays,\n",
      "“The Wonder-Dreamers” and “The Yardstick of the Ego.” And on essays,\n",
      "long and short, he began to pay the travelling expenses from magazine\n",
      "to magazine.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the twenty-five days spent on “The Shame of the Sun,” he sold\n",
      "hack-work to the extent of six dollars and fifty cents. A joke had\n",
      "brought in fifty cents, and a second one, sold to a high-grade comic\n",
      "weekly, had fetched a dollar. Then two humorous poems had earned two\n",
      "dollars and three dollars respectively. As a result, having exhausted\n",
      "his credit with the tradesmen (though he had increased his credit with\n",
      "the grocer to five dollars), his wheel and suit of clothes went back to\n",
      "the pawnbroker. The type-writer people were again clamoring for money,\n",
      "insistently pointing out that according to the agreement rent was to be\n",
      "paid strictly in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encouraged by his several small sales, Martin went back to hack-work.\n",
      "Perhaps there was a living in it, after all. Stored away under his\n",
      "table were the twenty storiettes which had been rejected by the\n",
      "newspaper short-story syndicate. He read them over in order to find out\n",
      "how not to write newspaper storiettes, and so doing, reasoned out the\n",
      "perfect formula. He found that the newspaper storiette should never be\n",
      "tragic, should never end unhappily, and should never contain beauty of\n",
      "language, subtlety of thought, nor real delicacy of sentiment.\n",
      "Sentiment it must contain, plenty of it, pure and noble, of the sort\n",
      "that in his own early youth had brought his applause from “nigger\n",
      "heaven”—the “For-God-my-country-and-the-Czar” and\n",

      "Having learned such precautions, Martin consulted “The Duchess” for\n",

      "of three parts: (1) a pair of lovers are jarred apart; (2) by some deed\n",
      "or event they are reunited; (3) marriage bells. The third part was an\n",
      "unvarying quantity, but the first and second parts could be varied an\n",
      "infinite number of times. Thus, the pair of lovers could be jarred\n",
      "apart by misunderstood motives, by accident of fate, by jealous rivals,\n",
      "by irate parents, by crafty guardians, by scheming relatives, and so\n",
      "forth and so forth; they could be reunited by a brave deed of the man\n",
      "lover, by a similar deed of the woman lover, by change of heart in one\n",
      "lover or the other, by forced confession of crafty guardian, scheming\n",
      "relative, or jealous rival, by voluntary confession of same, by\n",
      "discovery of some unguessed secret, by lover storming girl’s heart, by\n",
      "lover making long and noble self-sacrifice, and so on, endlessly. It\n",
      "was very fetching to make the girl propose in the course of being\n",
      "reunited, and Martin discovered, bit by bit, other decidedly piquant\n",
      "and fetching ruses. But marriage bells at the end was the one thing he\n",
      "could take no liberties with; though the heavens rolled up as a scroll\n",
      "and the stars fell, the wedding bells must go on ringing just the same.\n",
      "In quantity, the formula prescribed twelve hundred words minimum dose,\n",
      "fifteen hundred words maximum dose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he got very far along in the art of the storiette, Martin worked\n",
      "out half a dozen stock forms, which he always consulted when\n",
      "constructing storiettes. These forms were like the cunning tables used\n",
      "by mathematicians, which may be entered from top, bottom, right, and\n",
      "left, which entrances consist of scores of lines and dozens of columns,\n",
      "and from which may be drawn, without reasoning or thinking, thousands\n",
      "of different conclusions, all unchallengably precise and true. Thus, in\n",
      "the course of half an hour with his forms, Martin could frame up a\n",
      "dozen or so storiettes, which he put aside and filled in at his\n",
      "convenience. He found that he could fill one in, after a day of serious\n",
      "work, in the hour before going to bed. As he later confessed to Ruth,\n",
      "he could almost do it in his sleep. The real work was in constructing\n",
      "the frames, and that was merely mechanical.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had no doubt whatever of the efficacy of his formula, and for once\n",
      "he knew the editorial mind when he said positively to himself that the\n",
      "first two he sent off would bring checks. And checks they brought, for\n",
      "four dollars each, at the end of twelve days.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime he was making fresh and alarming discoveries concerning\n",
      "the magazines. Though the _Transcontinental_ had published “The Ring of\n",
      "Bells,” no check was forthcoming. Martin needed it, and he wrote for\n",
      "it. An evasive answer and a request for more of his work was all he\n",
      "received. He had gone hungry two days waiting for the reply, and it was\n",
      "then that he put his wheel back in pawn. He wrote regularly, twice a\n",
      "week, to the _Transcontinental_ for his five dollars, though it was\n",
      "only semi-occasionally that he elicited a reply. He did not know that\n",
      "the _Transcontinental_ had been staggering along precariously for\n",
      "years, that it was a fourth-rater, or tenth-rater, without standing,\n",
      "with a crazy circulation that partly rested on petty bullying and\n",
      "partly on patriotic appealing, and with advertisements that were\n",
      "scarcely more than charitable donations. Nor did he know that the\n",
      "_Transcontinental_ was the sole livelihood of the editor and the\n",
      "business manager, and that they could wring their livelihood out of it\n",
      "only by moving to escape paying rent and by never paying any bill they\n",
      "could evade. Nor could he have guessed that the particular five dollars\n",
      "that belonged to him had been appropriated by the business manager for\n",
      "the painting of his house in Alameda, which painting he performed\n",
      "himself, on week-day afternoons, because he could not afford to pay\n",

      "word could he get from the editor. His letters were ignored. To satisfy\n",
      "himself that they had been received, he registered several of them. It\n",
      "was nothing less than robbery, he concluded—a cold-blooded steal; while\n",

      "society weekly in San Francisco. His chief reason for submitting it to\n",
      "that publication was that, having only to travel across the bay from\n",
      "Oakland, a quick decision could be reached. Two weeks later he was\n",
      "overjoyed to see, in the latest number on the news-stand, his story\n",
      "printed in full, illustrated, and in the place of honor. He went home\n",
      "with leaping pulse, wondering how much they would pay him for one of\n",
      "the best things he had done. Also, the celerity with which it had been\n",
      "accepted and published was a pleasant thought to him. That the editor\n",
      "had not informed him of the acceptance made the surprise more complete.\n",
      "After waiting a week, two weeks, and half a week longer, desperation\n",
      "conquered diffidence, and he wrote to the editor of _The Billow_,\n",

      "into a constellation of the first magnitude by the brilliant journalist\n",
      "who founded it. But _The Hornet’s_ light had begun to dim long before\n",

      "that he did not think much of “The Peri and the Pearl” anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "But _The Globe_, a Chicago magazine, gave Martin the most cruel\n",
      "treatment of all. He had refrained from offering his “Sea Lyrics” for\n",
      "publication, until driven to it by starvation. After having been\n",
      "rejected by a dozen magazines, they had come to rest in _The Globe_\n",
      "office. There were thirty poems in the collection, and he was to\n",
      "receive a dollar apiece for them. The first month four were published,\n",
      "and he promptly received a check for four dollars; but when he looked\n",
      "over the magazine, he was appalled at the slaughter. In some cases the\n",
      "titles had been altered: “Finis,” for instance, being changed to “The\n",
      "Finish,” and “The Song of the Outer Reef” to “The Song of the Coral\n",
      "Reef.” In one case, an absolutely different title, a misappropriate\n",
      "title, was substituted. In place of his own, “Medusa Lights,” the\n",
      "editor had printed, “The Backward Track.” But the slaughter in the body\n",
      "of the poems was terrifying. Martin groaned and sweated and thrust his\n",
      "hands through his hair. Phrases, lines, and stanzas were cut out,\n",
      "interchanged, or juggled about in the most incomprehensible manner.\n",
      "Sometimes lines and stanzas not his own were substituted for his. He\n",
      "could not believe that a sane editor could be guilty of such\n",
      "maltreatment, and his favorite hypothesis was that his poems must have\n",
      "been doctored by the office boy or the stenographer. Martin wrote\n",
      "immediately, begging the editor to cease publishing the lyrics and to\n",
      "return them to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrote again and again, begging, entreating, threatening, but his\n",
      "letters were ignored. Month by month the slaughter went on till the\n",
      "thirty poems were published, and month by month he received a check for\n",
      "those which had appeared in the current number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these various misadventures, the memory of the _White Mouse_\n",
      "forty-dollar check sustained him, though he was driven more and more to\n",
      "hack-work. He discovered a bread-and-butter field in the agricultural\n",
      "weeklies and trade journals, though among the religious weeklies he\n",
      "found he could easily starve. At his lowest ebb, when his black suit\n",
      "was in pawn, he made a ten-strike—or so it seemed to him—in a prize\n",
      "contest arranged by the County Committee of the Republican Party. There\n",
      "were three branches of the contest, and he entered them all, laughing\n",
      "at himself bitterly the while in that he was driven to such straits to\n",
      "live. His poem won the first prize of ten dollars, his campaign song\n",
      "the second prize of five dollars, his essay on the principles of the\n",
      "Republican Party the first prize of twenty-five dollars. Which was very\n",
      "gratifying to him until he tried to collect. Something had gone wrong\n",
      "in the County Committee, and, though a rich banker and a state senator\n",
      "were members of it, the money was not forthcoming. While this affair\n",
      "was hanging fire, he proved that he understood the principles of the\n",
      "Democratic Party by winning the first prize for his essay in a similar\n",

      "Driven to shifts in order to see Ruth, and deciding that the long walk\n",
      "from north Oakland to her house and back again consumed too much time,\n",
      "he kept his black suit in pawn in place of his bicycle. The latter gave\n",
      "him exercise, saved him hours of time for work, and enabled him to see\n",
      "Ruth just the same. A pair of knee duck trousers and an old sweater\n",
      "made him a presentable wheel costume, so that he could go with Ruth on\n",
      "afternoon rides. Besides, he no longer had opportunity to see much of\n",

      "campaign of entertainment. The exalted beings he met there, and to whom\n",
      "he had looked up but a short time before, now bored him. They were no\n",
      "longer exalted. He was nervous and irritable, what of his hard times,\n",
      "disappointments, and close application to work, and the conversation of\n",
      "such people was maddening. He was not unduly egotistic. He measured the\n",

      "read. At Ruth’s home he never met a large mind, with the exception of\n",
      "Professor Caldwell, and Caldwell he had met there only once. As for the\n",
      "rest, they were numskulls, ninnies, superficial, dogmatic, and\n",
      "ignorant. It was their ignorance that astounded him. What was the\n",
      "matter with them? What had they done with their educations? They had\n",
      "had access to the same books he had. How did it happen that they had\n",
      "drawn nothing from them?\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew that the great minds, the deep and rational thinkers, existed.\n",
      "He had his proofs from the books, the books that had educated him\n",
      "beyond the Morse standard. And he knew that higher intellects than\n",
      "those of the Morse circle were to be found in the world. He read\n",
      "English society novels, wherein he caught glimpses of men and women\n",
      "talking politics and philosophy. And he read of salons in great cities,\n",
      "even in the United States, where art and intellect congregated.\n",
      "Foolishly, in the past, he had conceived that all well-groomed persons\n",
      "above the working class were persons with power of intellect and vigor\n",
      "of beauty. Culture and collars had gone together, to him, and he had\n",
      "been deceived into believing that college educations and mastery were\n",
      "the same things.\n",

      "Well, he would fight his way on and up higher. And he would take Ruth\n",
      "with him. Her he dearly loved, and he was confident that she would\n",
      "shine anywhere. As it was clear to him that he had been handicapped by\n",
      "his early environment, so now he perceived that she was similarly\n",
      "handicapped. She had not had a chance to expand. The books on her\n",
      "father’s shelves, the paintings on the walls, the music on the\n",
      "piano—all was just so much meretricious display. To real literature,\n",
      "real painting, real music, the Morses and their kind, were dead. And\n",
      "bigger than such things was life, of which they were densely,\n",
      "hopelessly ignorant. In spite of their Unitarian proclivities and their\n",
      "masks of conservative broadmindedness, they were two generations behind\n",
      "interpretative science: their mental processes were mediaeval, while\n",
      "their thinking on the ultimate data of existence and of the universe\n",
      "struck him as the same metaphysical method that was as young as the\n",
      "youngest race, as old as the cave-man, and older—the same that moved\n",
      "the first Pleistocene ape-man to fear the dark; that moved the first\n",
      "hasty Hebrew savage to incarnate Eve from Adam’s rib; that moved\n",
      "Descartes to build an idealistic system of the universe out of the\n",
      "projections of his own puny ego; and that moved the famous British\n",

      "the difference between these lawyers, officers, business men, and bank\n",

      "was on a par with the difference in the food they ate, clothes they\n",

      "lacking the something more which he found in himself and in the books.\n",
      "The Morses had shown him the best their social position could produce,\n",
      "and he was not impressed by it. A pauper himself, a slave to the\n",
      "money-lender, he knew himself the superior of those he met at the\n",
      "Morses’; and, when his one decent suit of clothes was out of pawn, he\n",

      "\n",
      "The conversation had been swung in that direction by Mrs. Morse, who\n",
      "had been invidiously singing the praises of Mr. Hapgood. The cashier\n",

      "“What makes you think so?” Mrs. Morse had inquired.\n",
      "\n",

      "unoriginal, and also so convincing, that the leaders cannot help but\n",
      "regard him as safe and sure, while his platitudes are so much like the\n",
      "platitudes of the average voter that—oh, well, you know you flatter any\n",

      "him.”\n",

      "very few of them are crafty. The only wise Republicans are the\n",
      "millionnaires and their conscious henchmen. They know which side their\n",
      "bread is buttered on, and they know why.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Henchman?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, yes. You do corporation work. You have no working-class nor\n",
      "criminal practice. You don’t depend upon wife-beaters and pickpockets\n",
      "for your income. You get your livelihood from the masters of society,\n",
      "and whoever feeds a man is that man’s master. Yes, you are a henchman.\n",

      "antagonism.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I say Republicans are stupid, and hold that liberty, equality,\n",
      "and fraternity are exploded bubbles, does not make me a socialist,”\n",
      "Martin said with a smile. “Because I question Jefferson and the\n",
      "unscientific Frenchmen who informed his mind, does not make me a\n",
      "socialist. Believe me, Mr. Morse, you are far nearer socialism than I\n",
      "who am its avowed enemy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now you please to be facetious,” was all the other could say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all. I speak in all seriousness. You still believe in equality,\n",
      "and yet you do the work of the corporations, and the corporations, from\n",
      "day to day, are busily engaged in burying equality. And you call me a\n",
      "socialist because I deny equality, because I affirm just what you live\n",
      "up to. The Republicans are foes to equality, though most of them fight\n",
      "the battle against equality with the very word itself the slogan on\n",
      "their lips. In the name of equality they destroy equality. That was why\n",
      "I called them stupid. As for myself, I am an individualist. I believe\n",
      "the race is to the swift, the battle to the strong. Such is the lesson\n",
      "I have learned from biology, or at least think I have learned. As I\n",
      "said, I am an individualist, and individualism is the hereditary and\n",
      "eternal foe of socialism.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you frequent socialist meetings,” Mr. Morse challenged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, just as spies frequent hostile camps. How else are you to\n",
      "learn about the enemy? Besides, I enjoy myself at their meetings. They\n",
      "are good fighters, and, right or wrong, they have read the books. Any\n",
      "one of them knows far more about sociology and all the other ologies\n",
      "than the average captain of industry. Yes, I have been to half a dozen\n",
      "of their meetings, but that doesn’t make me a socialist any more than\n",
      "hearing Charley Hapgood orate made me a Republican.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t help it,” Mr. Morse said feebly, “but I still believe you\n",
      "incline that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bless me, Martin thought to himself, he doesn’t know what I was talking\n",
      "about. He hasn’t understood a word of it. What did he do with his\n",
      "education, anyway?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, in his development, Martin found himself face to face with\n",
      "economic morality, or the morality of class; and soon it became to him\n",
      "a grisly monster. Personally, he was an intellectual moralist, and more\n",
      "offending to him than platitudinous pomposity was the morality of those\n",
      "about him, which was a curious hotchpotch of the economic, the\n",
      "metaphysical, the sentimental, and the imitative.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sample of this curious messy mixture he encountered nearer home. His\n",
      "sister Marian had been keeping company with an industrious young\n",
      "mechanic, of German extraction, who, after thoroughly learning the\n",
      "trade, had set up for himself in a bicycle-repair shop. Also, having\n",
      "got the agency for a low-grade make of wheel, he was prosperous. Marian\n",
      "had called on Martin in his room a short time before to announce her\n",
      "engagement, during which visit she had playfully inspected Martin’s\n",
      "palm and told his fortune. On her next visit she brought Hermann von\n",
      "Schmidt along with her. Martin did the honors and congratulated both of\n",
      "them in language so easy and graceful as to affect disagreeably the\n",
      "peasant-mind of his sister’s lover. This bad impression was further\n",
      "heightened by Martin’s reading aloud the half-dozen stanzas of verse\n",
      "with which he had commemorated Marian’s previous visit. It was a bit of\n",
      "society verse, airy and delicate, which he had named “The Palmist.” He\n",
      "was surprised, when he finished reading it, to note no enjoyment in his\n",
      "sister’s face. Instead, her eyes were fixed anxiously upon her\n",
      "betrothed, and Martin, following her gaze, saw spread on that worthy’s\n",
      "asymmetrical features nothing but black and sullen disapproval. The\n",
      "incident passed over, they made an early departure, and Martin forgot\n",
      "all about it, though for the moment he had been puzzled that any woman,\n",
      "even of the working class, should not have been flattered and delighted\n",
      "by having poetry written about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several evenings later Marian again visited him, this time alone. Nor\n",
      "did she waste time in coming to the point, upbraiding him sorrowfully\n",
      "for what he had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Marian,” he chided, “you talk as though you were ashamed of your\n",
      "relatives, or of your brother at any rate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I am, too,” she blurted out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin was bewildered by the tears of mortification he saw in her eyes.\n",
      "The mood, whatever it was, was genuine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Marian, why should your Hermann be jealous of my writing poetry\n",
      "about my own sister?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He ain’t jealous,” she sobbed. “He says it was indecent, ob—obscene.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin emitted a long, low whistle of incredulity, then proceeded to\n",
      "resurrect and read a carbon copy of “The Palmist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t see it,” he said finally, proffering the manuscript to her.\n",
      "“Read it yourself and show me whatever strikes you as obscene—that was\n",
      "the word, wasn’t it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He says so, and he ought to know,” was the answer, with a wave aside\n",
      "of the manuscript, accompanied by a look of loathing. “And he says\n",
      "you’ve got to tear it up. He says he won’t have no wife of his with\n",
      "such things written about her which anybody can read. He says it’s a\n",
      "disgrace, an’ he won’t stand for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, look here, Marian, this is nothing but nonsense,” Martin began;\n",
      "then abruptly changed his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw before him an unhappy girl, knew the futility of attempting to\n",
      "convince her husband or her, and, though the whole situation was absurd\n",
      "and preposterous, he resolved to surrender.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” he announced, tearing the manuscript into half a dozen\n",
      "pieces and throwing it into the waste-basket.\n",
      "\n",
      "He contented himself with the knowledge that even then the original\n",
      "type-written manuscript was reposing in the office of a New York\n",
      "magazine. Marian and her husband would never know, and neither himself\n",
      "nor they nor the world would lose if the pretty, harmless poem ever\n",
      "were published.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marian, starting to reach into the waste-basket, refrained.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can I?” she pleaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "He nodded his head, regarding her thoughtfully as she gathered the torn\n",
      "pieces of manuscript and tucked them into the pocket of her\n",
      "jacket—ocular evidence of the success of her mission. She reminded him\n",
      "of Lizzie Connolly, though there was less of fire and gorgeous\n",
      "flaunting life in her than in that other girl of the working class whom\n",
      "he had seen twice. But they were on a par, the pair of them, in dress\n",
      "and carriage, and he smiled with inward amusement at the caprice of his\n",
      "fancy which suggested the appearance of either of them in Mrs. Morse’s\n",
      "drawing-room. The amusement faded, and he was aware of a great\n",
      "loneliness. This sister of his and the Morse drawing-room were\n",
      "milestones of the road he had travelled. And he had left them behind.\n",
      "He glanced affectionately about him at his few books. They were all the\n",
      "comrades left to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, what’s that?” he demanded in startled surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marian repeated her question.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t I go to work?” He broke into a laugh that was only\n",
      "half-hearted. “That Hermann of yours has been talking to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t lie,” he commanded, and the nod of her head affirmed his charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you tell that Hermann of yours to mind his own business; that\n",
      "when I write poetry about the girl he’s keeping company with it’s his\n",
      "business, but that outside of that he’s got no say so. Understand?\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you don’t think I’ll succeed as a writer, eh?” he went on. “You\n",
      "think I’m no good?—that I’ve fallen down and am a disgrace to the\n",
      "family?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it would be much better if you got a job,” she said firmly,\n",
      "and he saw she was sincere. “Hermann says—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Damn Hermann!” he broke out good-naturedly. “What I want to know is\n",
      "when you’re going to get married. Also, you find out from your Hermann\n",
      "if he will deign to permit you to accept a wedding present from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He mused over the incident after she had gone, and once or twice broke\n",
      "out into laughter that was bitter as he saw his sister and her\n",
      "betrothed, all the members of his own class and the members of Ruth’s\n",
      "class, directing their narrow little lives by narrow little\n",
      "formulas—herd-creatures, flocking together and patterning their lives\n",
      "by one another’s opinions, failing of being individuals and of really\n",
      "living life because of the childlike formulas by which they were\n",
      "enslaved. He summoned them before him in apparitional procession:\n",
      "Bernard Higginbotham arm in arm with Mr. Butler, Hermann von Schmidt\n",
      "cheek by jowl with Charley Hapgood, and one by one and in pairs he\n",
      "judged them and dismissed them—judged them by the standards of\n",
      "intellect and morality he had learned from the books. Vainly he asked:\n",
      "Where are the great souls, the great men and women? He found them not\n",
      "among the careless, gross, and stupid intelligences that answered the\n",
      "call of vision to his narrow room. He felt a loathing for them such as\n",
      "Circe must have felt for her swine. When he had dismissed the last one\n",
      "and thought himself alone, a late-comer entered, unexpected and\n",
      "unsummoned. Martin watched him and saw the stiff-rim, the square-cut,\n",

      "proud, and all that—I could not be a true woman were it otherwise—that\n",
      "you should write these poems to me. But they do not make our marriage\n",
      "possible. Don’t you see, Martin? Don’t think me mercenary. It is love,\n",
      "the thought of our future, with which I am burdened. A whole year has\n",

      "nearer. Don’t think me immodest in thus talking about our wedding, for\n",

      "all hack from morning till night, is the one paramount thing of life.\n",
      "And it is a whirlwind life, the life of the moment, with neither past\n",
      "nor future, and certainly without thought of any style but reportorial\n",
      "style, and that certainly is not literature. To become a reporter now,\n",
      "just as my style is taking form, crystallizing, would be to commit\n",

      "storiette, was a violation of myself, of my self-respect, of my respect\n",

      "earning her Bachelorship of Arts; but she was not original, not\n",

      "as the average person unconsciously believes, not merely in present\n",
      "conditions, but in all conditions. It is their ignorance, of course,\n",
      "that makes them believe such rot—their ignorance, which is nothing more\n",

      "“They arrived by achieving the impossible,” he answered. “They did such\n",
      "blazing, glorious work as to burn to ashes those that opposed them.\n",
      "They arrived by course of miracle, by winning a thousand-to-one wager\n",

      "demanded to be heard. I was very undutiful. They are against you, you\n",
      "know; but I assured them over and over of my abiding love for you, and\n",
      "at last father agreed that if you wanted to, you could begin right away\n",
      "in his office. And then, of his own accord, he said he would pay you\n",

      "The question was answered for him, and so oppressed was he by the\n",

      "willing to wait the answer till she should bring the question up again.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not long to wait. Martin had a question of his own to propound\n",
      "to her. He wanted to ascertain the measure of her faith in him, and\n",
      "within the week each was answered. Martin precipitated it by reading to\n",
      "her his “The Shame of the Sun.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t you become a reporter?” she asked when he had finished. “You\n",
      "love writing so, and I am sure you would succeed. You could rise in\n",
      "journalism and make a name for yourself. There are a number of great\n",
      "special correspondents. Their salaries are large, and their field is\n",
      "the world. They are sent everywhere, to the heart of Africa, like\n",
      "Stanley, or to interview the Pope, or to explore unknown Thibet.”\n",
      "\n",

      "heads of your readers. At least it is over mine. It sounds beautiful,\n",
      "but I don’t understand it. Your scientific slang is beyond me. You are\n",

      "not be intelligible to the rest of us.”\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“After all, your writing has been a toy to you,” she was saying.\n",

      "\n",
      "“But they sell theirs, and you—don’t.”\n",
      "\n",

      "at all my vocation?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I will answer.” She steeled herself to do it. “I don’t think you\n",
      "were made to write. Forgive me, dear. You compel me to say it; and you\n",
      "know I know more about literature than you do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, you are a Bachelor of Arts,” he said meditatively; “and you ought\n",
      "to know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there is more to be said,” he continued, after a pause painful to\n",
      "both. “I know what I have in me. No one knows that so well as I. I know\n",
      "I shall succeed. I will not be kept down. I am afire with what I have\n",
      "to say in verse, and fiction, and essay. I do not ask you to have faith\n",
      "in that, though. I do not ask you to have faith in me, nor in my\n",

      "that I must serve my apprenticeship to writing. Well, I have served it.\n",
      "I have crammed it and telescoped it. With you at the end awaiting me, I\n",
      "have never shirked. Do you know, I have forgotten what it is to fall\n",
      "peacefully asleep. A few million years ago I knew what it was to sleep\n",
      "my fill and to awake naturally from very glut of sleep. I am awakened\n",
      "always now by an alarm clock. If I fall asleep early or late, I set the\n",

      "was afraid to sleep. Kipling wrote the story. This man arranged a spur\n",
      "so that when unconsciousness came, his naked body pressed against the\n",
      "iron teeth. Well, I’ve done the same. I look at the time, and I resolve\n",
      "that not until midnight, or not until one o’clock, or two o’clock, or\n",
      "three o’clock, shall the spur be removed. And so it rowels me awake\n",
      "until the appointed time. That spur has been my bed-mate for months. I\n",
      "have grown so desperate that five and a half hours of sleep is an\n",
      "extravagance. I sleep four hours now. I am starved for sleep. There are\n",
      "times when I am light-headed from want of sleep, times when death, with\n",

      "child, the infatuated man striving to achieve the impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toward the close of their talk she warned him again of the antagonism\n",
      "of her father and mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you love me?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do! I do!” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I love you, not them, and nothing they do can hurt me.” Triumph\n",
      "sounded in his voice. “For I have faith in your love, not fear of their\n",
      "enmity. All things may go astray in this world, but not love. Love\n",
      "cannot go wrong unless it be a weakling that faints and stumbles by the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin had encountered his sister Gertrude by chance on Broadway—as it\n",
      "proved, a most propitious yet disconcerting chance. Waiting on the\n",
      "corner for a car, she had seen him first, and noted the eager, hungry\n",
      "lines of his face and the desperate, worried look of his eyes. In\n",
      "truth, he was desperate and worried. He had just come from a fruitless\n",
      "interview with the pawnbroker, from whom he had tried to wring an\n",
      "additional loan on his wheel. The muddy fall weather having come on,\n",
      "Martin had pledged his wheel some time since and retained his black\n",
      "suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s the black suit,” the pawnbroker, who knew his every asset, had\n",
      "answered. “You needn’t tell me you’ve gone and pledged it with that\n",
      "Jew, Lipka. Because if you have—”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man had looked the threat, and Martin hastened to cry:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no; I’ve got it. But I want to wear it on a matter of business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” the mollified usurer had replied. “And I want it on a\n",
      "matter of business before I can let you have any more money. You don’t\n",
      "think I’m in it for my health?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it’s a forty-dollar wheel, in good condition,” Martin had argued.\n",
      "“And you’ve only let me have seven dollars on it. No, not even seven.\n",
      "Six and a quarter; you took the interest in advance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you want some more, bring the suit,” had been the reply that sent\n",
      "Martin out of the stuffy little den, so desperate at heart as to\n",
      "reflect it in his face and touch his sister to pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely had they met when the Telegraph Avenue car came along and\n",
      "stopped to take on a crowd of afternoon shoppers. Mrs. Higginbotham\n",
      "divined from the grip on her arm as he helped her on, that he was not\n",
      "going to follow her. She turned on the step and looked down upon him.\n",
      "His haggard face smote her to the heart again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ain’t you comin’?” she asked\n",
      "\n",
      "The next moment she had descended to his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m walking—exercise, you know,” he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I’ll go along for a few blocks,” she announced. “Mebbe it’ll do\n",
      "me good. I ain’t ben feelin’ any too spry these last few days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin glanced at her and verified her statement in her general\n",
      "slovenly appearance, in the unhealthy fat, in the drooping shoulders,\n",
      "the tired face with the sagging lines, and in the heavy fall of her\n",
      "feet, without elasticity—a very caricature of the walk that belongs to\n",
      "a free and happy body.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’d better stop here,” he said, though she had already come to a\n",
      "halt at the first corner, “and take the next car.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My goodness!—if I ain’t all tired a’ready!” she panted. “But I’m just\n",
      "as able to walk as you in them soles. They’re that thin they’ll bu’st\n",
      "long before you git out to North Oakland.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve a better pair at home,” was the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come out to dinner to-morrow,” she invited irrelevantly. “Mr.\n",
      "Higginbotham won’t be there. He’s goin’ to San Leandro on business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin shook his head, but he had failed to keep back the wolfish,\n",
      "hungry look that leapt into his eyes at the suggestion of dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You haven’t a penny, Mart, and that’s why you’re walkin’. Exercise!”\n",
      "She tried to sniff contemptuously, but succeeded in producing only a\n",
      "sniffle. “Here, lemme see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And, fumbling in her satchel, she pressed a five-dollar piece into his\n",
      "hand. “I guess I forgot your last birthday, Mart,” she mumbled lamely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin’s hand instinctively closed on the piece of gold. In the same\n",
      "instant he knew he ought not to accept, and found himself struggling in\n",
      "the throes of indecision. That bit of gold meant food, life, and light\n",
      "in his body and brain, power to go on writing, and—who was to\n",
      "say?—maybe to write something that would bring in many pieces of gold.\n",
      "Clear on his vision burned the manuscripts of two essays he had just\n",
      "completed. He saw them under the table on top of the heap of returned\n",
      "manuscripts for which he had no stamps, and he saw their titles, just\n",
      "as he had typed them—“The High Priests of Mystery,” and “The Cradle of\n",
      "Beauty.” He had never submitted them anywhere. They were as good as\n",
      "anything he had done in that line. If only he had stamps for them! Then\n",
      "the certitude of his ultimate success rose up in him, an able ally of\n",
      "hunger, and with a quick movement he slipped the coin into his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll pay you back, Gertrude, a hundred times over,” he gulped out, his\n",
      "throat painfully contracted and in his eyes a swift hint of moisture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mark my words!” he cried with abrupt positiveness. “Before the year is\n",
      "out I’ll put an even hundred of those little yellow-boys into your\n",
      "hand. I don’t ask you to believe me. All you have to do is wait and\n",
      "see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor did she believe. Her incredulity made her uncomfortable, and\n",
      "failing of other expedient, she said:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know you’re hungry, Mart. It’s sticking out all over you. Come in to\n",
      "meals any time. I’ll send one of the children to tell you when Mr.\n",
      "Higginbotham ain’t to be there. An’ Mart—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited, though he knew in his secret heart what she was about to\n",
      "say, so visible was her thought process to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you think it’s about time you got a job?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t think I’ll win out?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "She shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody has faith in me, Gertrude, except myself.” His voice was\n",
      "passionately rebellious. “I’ve done good work already, plenty of it,\n",
      "and sooner or later it will sell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you know it is good?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because—” He faltered as the whole vast field of literature and the\n",
      "history of literature stirred in his brain and pointed the futility of\n",
      "his attempting to convey to her the reasons for his faith. “Well,\n",
      "because it’s better than ninety-nine per cent of what is published in\n",
      "the magazines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish’t you’d listen to reason,” she answered feebly, but with\n",
      "unwavering belief in the correctness of her diagnosis of what was\n",
      "ailing him. “I wish’t you’d listen to reason,” she repeated, “an’ come\n",
      "to dinner to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After Martin had helped her on the car, he hurried to the post-office\n",
      "and invested three of the five dollars in stamps; and when, later in\n",
      "the day, on the way to the Morse home, he stopped in at the post-office\n",
      "to weigh a large number of long, bulky envelopes, he affixed to them\n",
      "all the stamps save three of the two-cent denomination.\n",
      "\n",
      "It proved a momentous night for Martin, for after dinner he met Russ\n",
      "Brissenden. How he chanced to come there, whose friend he was or what\n",
      "acquaintance brought him, Martin did not know. Nor had he the curiosity\n",
      "to inquire about him of Ruth. In short, Brissenden struck Martin as\n",
      "anaemic and feather-brained, and was promptly dismissed from his mind.\n",
      "An hour later he decided that Brissenden was a boor as well, what of\n",
      "the way he prowled about from one room to another, staring at the\n",
      "pictures or poking his nose into books and magazines he picked up from\n",
      "the table or drew from the shelves. Though a stranger in the house he\n",
      "finally isolated himself in the midst of the company, huddling into a\n",
      "capacious Morris chair and reading steadily from a thin volume he had\n",
      "drawn from his pocket. As he read, he abstractedly ran his fingers,\n",
      "with a caressing movement, through his hair. Martin noticed him no more\n",
      "that evening, except once when he observed him chaffing with great\n",
      "apparent success with several of the young women.\n",
      "\n",
      "It chanced that when Martin was leaving, he overtook Brissenden already\n",
      "half down the walk to the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, is that you?” Martin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other replied with an ungracious grunt, but swung alongside. Martin\n",
      "made no further attempt at conversation, and for several blocks\n",
      "unbroken silence lay upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pompous old ass!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The suddenness and the virulence of the exclamation startled Martin. He\n",
      "felt amused, and at the same time was aware of a growing dislike for\n",
      "the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you go to such a place for?” was abruptly flung at him after\n",
      "another block of silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you?” Martin countered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bless me, I don’t know,” came back. “At least this is my first\n",
      "indiscretion. There are twenty-four hours in each day, and I must spend\n",
      "them somehow. Come and have a drink.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” Martin answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next moment he was nonplussed by the readiness of his acceptance.\n",
      "At home was several hours’ hack-work waiting for him before he went to\n",
      "bed, and after he went to bed there was a volume of Weismann waiting\n",
      "for him, to say nothing of Herbert Spencer’s Autobiography, which was\n",
      "as replete for him with romance as any thrilling novel. Why should he\n",
      "waste any time with this man he did not like? was his thought. And yet,\n",
      "it was not so much the man nor the drink as was it what was associated\n",
      "with the drink—the bright lights, the mirrors and dazzling array of\n",
      "glasses, the warm and glowing faces and the resonant hum of the voices\n",
      "of men. That was it, it was the voices of men, optimistic men, men who\n",
      "breathed success and spent their money for drinks like men. He was\n",
      "lonely, that was what was the matter with him; that was why he had\n",
      "snapped at the invitation as a bonita strikes at a white rag on a hook.\n",
      "Not since with Joe, at Shelly Hot Springs, with the one exception of\n",
      "the wine he took with the Portuguese grocer, had Martin had a drink at\n",
      "a public bar. Mental exhaustion did not produce a craving for liquor\n",
      "such as physical exhaustion did, and he had felt no need for it. But\n",
      "just now he felt desire for the drink, or, rather, for the atmosphere\n",
      "wherein drinks were dispensed and disposed of. Such a place was the\n",
      "Grotto, where Brissenden and he lounged in capacious leather chairs and\n",
      "drank Scotch and soda.\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked. They talked about many things, and now Brissenden and now\n",
      "Martin took turn in ordering Scotch and soda. Martin, who was extremely\n",
      "strong-headed, marvelled at the other’s capacity for liquor, and ever\n",
      "and anon broke off to marvel at the other’s conversation. He was not\n",
      "long in assuming that Brissenden knew everything, and in deciding that\n",
      "here was the second intellectual man he had met. But he noted that\n",
      "Brissenden had what Professor Caldwell lacked—namely, fire, the\n",
      "flashing insight and perception, the flaming uncontrol of genius.\n",
      "Living language flowed from him. His thin lips, like the dies of a\n",
      "machine, stamped out phrases that cut and stung; or again, pursing\n",
      "caressingly about the inchoate sound they articulated, the thin lips\n",
      "shaped soft and velvety things, mellow phrases of glow and glory, of\n",
      "haunting beauty, reverberant of the mystery and inscrutableness of\n",
      "life; and yet again the thin lips were like a bugle, from which rang\n",
      "the crash and tumult of cosmic strife, phrases that sounded clear as\n",
      "silver, that were luminous as starry spaces, that epitomized the final\n",
      "word of science and yet said something more—the poet’s word, the\n",
      "transcendental truth, elusive and without words which could express,\n",
      "and which none the less found expression in the subtle and all but\n",
      "ungraspable connotations of common words. He, by some wonder of vision,\n",
      "saw beyond the farthest outpost of empiricism, where was no language\n",
      "for narration, and yet, by some golden miracle of speech, investing\n",
      "known words with unknown significances, he conveyed to Martin’s\n",
      "consciousness messages that were incommunicable to ordinary souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin forgot his first impression of dislike. Here was the best the\n",
      "books had to offer coming true. Here was an intelligence, a living man\n",
      "for him to look up to. “I am down in the dirt at your feet,” Martin\n",
      "repeated to himself again and again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve studied biology,” he said aloud, in significant allusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his surprise Brissenden shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you are stating truths that are substantiated only by biology,”\n",
      "Martin insisted, and was rewarded by a blank stare. “Your conclusions\n",
      "are in line with the books which you must have read.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad to hear it,” was the answer. “That my smattering of\n",
      "knowledge should enable me to short-cut my way to truth is most\n",
      "reassuring. As for myself, I never bother to find out if I am right or\n",
      "not. It is all valueless anyway. Man can never know the ultimate\n",
      "verities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a disciple of Spencer!” Martin cried triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t read him since adolescence, and all I read then was his\n",
      "‘Education.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I could gather knowledge as carelessly,” Martin broke out half\n",
      "an hour later. He had been closely analyzing Brissenden’s mental\n",
      "equipment. “You are a sheer dogmatist, and that’s what makes it so\n",
      "marvellous. You state dogmatically the latest facts which science has\n",
      "been able to establish only by _à posteriori_ reasoning. You jump at\n",
      "correct conclusions. You certainly short-cut with a vengeance. You feel\n",
      "your way with the speed of light, by some hyperrational process, to\n",
      "truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that was what used to bother Father Joseph, and Brother Dutton,”\n",
      "Brissenden replied. “Oh, no,” he added; “I am not anything. It was a\n",
      "lucky trick of fate that sent me to a Catholic college for my\n",
      "education. Where did you pick up what you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "And while Martin told him, he was busy studying Brissenden, ranging\n",
      "from a long, lean, aristocratic face and drooping shoulders to the\n",
      "overcoat on a neighboring chair, its pockets sagged and bulged by the\n",
      "freightage of many books. Brissenden’s face and long, slender hands\n",
      "were browned by the sun—excessively browned, Martin thought. This\n",
      "sunburn bothered Martin. It was patent that Brissenden was no outdoor\n",
      "man. Then how had he been ravaged by the sun? Something morbid and\n",
      "significant attached to that sunburn, was Martin’s thought as he\n",
      "returned to a study of the face, narrow, with high cheek-bones and\n",
      "cavernous hollows, and graced with as delicate and fine an aquiline\n",
      "nose as Martin had ever seen. There was nothing remarkable about the\n",
      "size of the eyes. They were neither large nor small, while their color\n",
      "was a nondescript brown; but in them smouldered a fire, or, rather,\n",
      "lurked an expression dual and strangely contradictory. Defiant,\n",
      "indomitable, even harsh to excess, they at the same time aroused pity.\n",
      "Martin found himself pitying him he knew not why, though he was soon to\n",
      "learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I’m a lunger,” Brissenden announced, offhand, a little later,\n",
      "having already stated that he came from Arizona. “I’ve been down there\n",
      "a couple of years living on the climate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aren’t you afraid to venture it up in this climate?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Afraid?”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no special emphasis of his repetition of Martin’s word. But\n",
      "Martin saw in that ascetic face the advertisement that there was\n",
      "nothing of which it was afraid. The eyes had narrowed till they were\n",
      "eagle-like, and Martin almost caught his breath as he noted the eagle\n",
      "beak with its dilated nostrils, defiant, assertive, aggressive.\n",
      "Magnificent, was what he commented to himself, his blood thrilling at\n",
      "the sight. Aloud, he quoted:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Under the bludgeoning of Chance\n",
      "    My head is bloody but unbowed.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You like Henley,” Brissenden said, his expression changing swiftly to\n",
      "large graciousness and tenderness. “Of course, I couldn’t have expected\n",
      "anything else of you. Ah, Henley! A brave soul. He stands out among\n",
      "contemporary rhymesters—magazine rhymesters—as a gladiator stands out\n",
      "in the midst of a band of eunuchs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t like the magazines,” Martin softly impeached.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you?” was snarled back at him so savagely as to startle him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I—I write, or, rather, try to write, for the magazines,” Martin\n",
      "faltered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s better,” was the mollified rejoinder. “You try to write, but\n",
      "you don’t succeed. I respect and admire your failure. I know what you\n",
      "write. I can see it with half an eye, and there’s one ingredient in it\n",
      "that shuts it out of the magazines. It’s guts, and magazines have no\n",
      "use for that particular commodity. What they want is wish-wash and\n",
      "slush, and God knows they get it, but not from you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not above hack-work,” Martin contended.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the contrary—” Brissenden paused and ran an insolent eye over\n",
      "Martin’s objective poverty, passing from the well-worn tie and the\n",
      "saw-edged collar to the shiny sleeves of the coat and on to the slight\n",
      "fray of one cuff, winding up and dwelling upon Martin’s sunken cheeks.\n",
      "“On the contrary, hack-work is above you, so far above you that you can\n",
      "never hope to rise to it. Why, man, I could insult you by asking you to\n",
      "have something to eat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin felt the heat in his face of the involuntary blood, and\n",
      "Brissenden laughed triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A full man is not insulted by such an invitation,” he concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a devil,” Martin cried irritably.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anyway, I didn’t ask you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You didn’t dare.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I don’t know about that. I invite you now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brissenden half rose from his chair as he spoke, as if with the\n",
      "intention of departing to the restaurant forthwith.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin’s fists were tight-clenched, and his blood was drumming in his\n",
      "temples.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bosco! He eats ’em alive! Eats ’em alive!” Brissenden exclaimed,\n",
      "imitating the _spieler_ of a locally famous snake-eater.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could certainly eat you alive,” Martin said, in turn running\n",
      "insolent eyes over the other’s disease-ravaged frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only I’m not worthy of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the contrary,” Martin considered, “because the incident is not\n",
      "worthy.” He broke into a laugh, hearty and wholesome. “I confess you\n",
      "made a fool of me, Brissenden. That I am hungry and you are aware of it\n",
      "are only ordinary phenomena, and there’s no disgrace. You see, I laugh\n",
      "at the conventional little moralities of the herd; then you drift by,\n",
      "say a sharp, true word, and immediately I am the slave of the same\n",
      "little moralities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were insulted,” Brissenden affirmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I certainly was, a moment ago. The prejudice of early youth, you know.\n",
      "I learned such things then, and they cheapen what I have since learned.\n",
      "They are the skeletons in my particular closet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you’ve got the door shut on them now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I certainly have.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then let’s go and get something to eat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll go you,” Martin answered, attempting to pay for the current\n",
      "Scotch and soda with the last change from his two dollars and seeing\n",
      "the waiter bullied by Brissenden into putting that change back on the\n",
      "table.\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER XXXII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Promptly, the next afternoon, Maria was excited by Martin’s second\n",
      "visitor. But she did not lose her head this time, for she seated\n",
      "Brissenden in her parlor’s grandeur of respectability.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hope you don’t mind my coming?” Brissenden began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, not at all,” Martin answered, shaking hands and waving him to\n",
      "the solitary chair, himself taking to the bed. “But how did you know\n",
      "where I lived?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Called up the Morses. Miss Morse answered the ’phone. And here I am.”\n",
      "He tugged at his coat pocket and flung a thin volume on the table.\n",
      "“There’s a book, by a poet. Read it and keep it.” And then, in reply to\n",
      "Martin’s protest: “What have I to do with books? I had another\n",
      "hemorrhage this morning. Got any whiskey? No, of course not. Wait a\n",
      "minute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was off and away. Martin watched his long figure go down the outside\n",
      "steps, and, on turning to close the gate, noted with a pang the\n",
      "shoulders, which had once been broad, drawn in now over the collapsed\n",
      "ruin of the chest. Martin got two tumblers, and fell to reading the\n",
      "book of verse, Henry Vaughn Marlow’s latest collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No Scotch,” Brissenden announced on his return. “The beggar sells\n",
      "nothing but American whiskey. But here’s a quart of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll send one of the youngsters for lemons, and we’ll make a toddy,”\n",
      "Martin offered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder what a book like that will earn Marlow?” he went on, holding\n",
      "up the volume in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Possibly fifty dollars,” came the answer. “Though he’s lucky if he\n",
      "pulls even on it, or if he can inveigle a publisher to risk bringing it\n",
      "out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then one can’t make a living out of poetry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin’s tone and face alike showed his dejection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly not. What fool expects to? Out of rhyming, yes. There’s\n",
      "Bruce, and Virginia Spring, and Sedgwick. They do very nicely. But\n",
      "poetry—do you know how Vaughn Marlow makes his living?—teaching in a\n",
      "boys’ cramming-joint down in Pennsylvania, and of all private little\n",
      "hells such a billet is the limit. I wouldn’t trade places with him if\n",
      "he had fifty years of life before him. And yet his work stands out from\n",
      "the ruck of the contemporary versifiers as a balas ruby among carrots.\n",
      "And the reviews he gets! Damn them, all of them, the crass manikins!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Too much is written by the men who can’t write about the men who do\n",
      "write,” Martin concurred. “Why, I was appalled at the quantities of\n",
      "rubbish written about Stevenson and his work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ghouls and harpies!” Brissenden snapped out with clicking teeth. “Yes,\n",
      "I know the spawn—complacently pecking at him for his Father Damien\n",
      "letter, analyzing him, weighing him—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Measuring him by the yardstick of their own miserable egos,” Martin\n",
      "broke in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that’s it, a good phrase,—mouthing and besliming the True, and\n",
      "Beautiful, and Good, and finally patting him on the back and saying,\n",
      "‘Good dog, Fido.’ Faugh! ‘The little chattering daws of men,’ Richard\n",
      "Realf called them the night he died.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pecking at star-dust,” Martin took up the strain warmly; “at the\n",
      "meteoric flight of the master-men. I once wrote a squib on them—the\n",
      "critics, or the reviewers, rather.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s see it,” Brissenden begged eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Martin unearthed a carbon copy of “Star-dust,” and during the\n",
      "reading of it Brissenden chuckled, rubbed his hands, and forgot to sip\n",
      "his toddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Strikes me you’re a bit of star-dust yourself, flung into a world of\n",
      "cowled gnomes who cannot see,” was his comment at the end of it. “Of\n",
      "course it was snapped up by the first magazine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin ran over the pages of his manuscript book. “It has been refused\n",
      "by twenty-seven of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brissenden essayed a long and hearty laugh, but broke down in a fit of\n",
      "coughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, you needn’t tell me you haven’t tackled poetry,” he gasped. “Let\n",
      "me see some of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t read it now,” Martin pleaded. “I want to talk with you. I’ll\n",
      "make up a bundle and you can take it home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brissenden departed with the “Love-cycle,” and “The Peri and the\n",
      "Pearl,” returning next day to greet Martin with:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only did he assure Martin that he was a poet, but Martin learned\n",
      "that Brissenden also was one. He was swept off his feet by the other’s\n",
      "work, and astounded that no attempt had been made to publish it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A plague on all their houses!” was Brissenden’s answer to Martin’s\n",
      "volunteering to market his work for him. “Love Beauty for its own\n",
      "sake,” was his counsel, “and leave the magazines alone. Back to your\n",
      "ships and your sea—that’s my advice to you, Martin Eden. What do you\n",
      "want in these sick and rotten cities of men? You are cutting your\n",
      "throat every day you waste in them trying to prostitute beauty to the\n",
      "needs of magazinedom. What was it you quoted me the other day?—Oh, yes,\n",
      "‘Man, the latest of the ephemera.’ Well, what do you, the latest of the\n",
      "ephemera, want with fame? If you got it, it would be poison to you. You\n",
      "are too simple, too elemental, and too rational, by my faith, to\n",
      "prosper on such pap. I hope you never do sell a line to the magazines.\n",
      "Beauty is the only master to serve. Serve her and damn the multitude!\n",
      "Success! What in hell’s success if it isn’t right there in your\n",
      "Stevenson sonnet, which outranks Henley’s ‘Apparition,’ in that\n",
      "‘Love-cycle,’ in those sea-poems?\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not in what you succeed in doing that you get your joy, but in\n",
      "the doing of it. You can’t tell me. I know it. You know it. Beauty\n",
      "hurts you. It is an everlasting pain in you, a wound that does not\n",
      "heal, a knife of flame. Why should you palter with magazines? Let\n",
      "beauty be your end. Why should you mint beauty into gold? Anyway, you\n",
      "can’t; so there’s no use in my getting excited over it. You can read\n",
      "the magazines for a thousand years and you won’t find the value of one\n",
      "line of Keats. Leave fame and coin alone, sign away on a ship\n",
      "to-morrow, and go back to your sea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not for fame, but for love,” Martin laughed. “Love seems to have no\n",
      "place in your Cosmos; in mine, Beauty is the handmaiden of Love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brissenden looked at him pityingly and admiringly. “You are so young,\n",
      "Martin boy, so young. You will flutter high, but your wings are of the\n",
      "finest gauze, dusted with the fairest pigments. Do not scorch them. But\n",
      "of course you have scorched them already. It required some glorified\n",
      "petticoat to account for that ‘Love-cycle,’ and that’s the shame of\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It glorifies love as well as the petticoat,” Martin laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The philosophy of madness,” was the retort. “So have I assured myself\n",
      "when wandering in hasheesh dreams. But beware. These bourgeois cities\n",
      "will kill you. Look at that den of traitors where I met you. Dry rot is\n",
      "no name for it. One can’t keep his sanity in such an atmosphere. It’s\n",
      "degrading. There’s not one of them who is not degrading, man and woman,\n",
      "all of them animated stomachs guided by the high intellectual and\n",
      "artistic impulses of clams—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke off suddenly and regarded Martin. Then, with a flash of\n",
      "divination, he saw the situation. The expression on his face turned to\n",
      "wondering horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you wrote that tremendous ‘Love-cycle’ to her—that pale,\n",
      "shrivelled, female thing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The next instant Martin’s right hand had shot to a throttling clutch on\n",
      "his throat, and he was being shaken till his teeth rattled. But Martin,\n",
      "looking into his eyes, saw no fear there,—naught but a curious and\n",
      "mocking devil. Martin remembered himself, and flung Brissenden, by the\n",
      "neck, sidelong upon the bed, at the same moment releasing his hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brissenden panted and gasped painfully for a moment, then began to\n",
      "chuckle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had made me eternally your debtor had you shaken out the flame,”\n",
      "he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My nerves are on a hair-trigger these days,” Martin apologized. “Hope\n",
      "I didn’t hurt you. Here, let me mix a fresh toddy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, you young Greek!” Brissenden went on. “I wonder if you take just\n",
      "pride in that body of yours. You are devilish strong. You are a young\n",
      "panther, a lion cub. Well, well, it is you who must pay for that\n",
      "strength.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?” Martin asked curiously, passing him a glass. “Here,\n",
      "down this and be good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because—” Brissenden sipped his toddy and smiled appreciation of it.\n",
      "“Because of the women. They will worry you until you die, as they have\n",
      "already worried you, or else I was born yesterday. Now there’s no use\n",
      "in your choking me; I’m going to have my say. This is undoubtedly your\n",
      "calf love; but for Beauty’s sake show better taste next time. What\n",
      "under heaven do you want with a daughter of the bourgeoisie? Leave them\n",
      "alone. Pick out some great, wanton flame of a woman, who laughs at life\n",
      "and jeers at death and loves one while she may. There are such women,\n",
      "and they will love you just as readily as any pusillanimous product of\n",
      "bourgeois sheltered life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pusillanimous?” Martin protested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just so, pusillanimous; prattling out little moralities that have been\n",
      "prattled into them, and afraid to live life. They will love you,\n",
      "Martin, but they will love their little moralities more. What you want\n",
      "is the magnificent abandon of life, the great free souls, the blazing\n",
      "butterflies and not the little gray moths. Oh, you will grow tired of\n",
      "them, too, of all the female things, if you are unlucky enough to live.\n",
      "But you won’t live. You won’t go back to your ships and sea; therefore,\n",
      "you’ll hang around these pest-holes of cities until your bones are\n",
      "rotten, and then you’ll die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can lecture me, but you can’t make me talk back,” Martin said.\n",
      "“After all, you have but the wisdom of your temperament, and the wisdom\n",
      "of my temperament is just as unimpeachable as yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They disagreed about love, and the magazines, and many things, but they\n",
      "liked each other, and on Martin’s part it was no less than a profound\n",
      "liking. Day after day they were together, if for no more than the hour\n",
      "Brissenden spent in Martin’s stuffy room. Brissenden never arrived\n",
      "without his quart of whiskey, and when they dined together down-town,\n",
      "he drank Scotch and soda throughout the meal. He invariably paid the\n",
      "way for both, and it was through him that Martin learned the\n",
      "refinements of food, drank his first champagne, and made acquaintance\n",
      "with Rhenish wines.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Brissenden was always an enigma. With the face of an ascetic, he\n",
      "was, in all the failing blood of him, a frank voluptuary. He was\n",
      "unafraid to die, bitter and cynical of all the ways of living; and yet,\n",
      "dying, he loved life, to the last atom of it. He was possessed by a\n",
      "madness to live, to thrill, “to squirm my little space in the cosmic\n",
      "dust whence I came,” as he phrased it once himself. He had tampered\n",
      "with drugs and done many strange things in quest of new thrills, new\n",
      "sensations. As he told Martin, he had once gone three days without\n",
      "water, had done so voluntarily, in order to experience the exquisite\n",
      "delight of such a thirst assuaged. Who or what he was, Martin never\n",
      "learned. He was a man without a past, whose future was the imminent\n",
      "grave and whose present was a bitter fever of living.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin was steadily losing his battle. Economize as he would, the\n",
      "earnings from hack-work did not balance expenses. Thanksgiving found\n",
      "him with his black suit in pawn and unable to accept the Morses’\n",
      "invitation to dinner. Ruth was not made happy by his reason for not\n",
      "coming, and the corresponding effect on him was one of desperation. He\n",
      "told her that he would come, after all; that he would go over to San\n",
      "Francisco, to the _Transcontinental_ office, collect the five dollars\n",
      "due him, and with it redeem his suit of clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning he borrowed ten cents from Maria. He would have borrowed\n",
      "it, by preference, from Brissenden, but that erratic individual had\n",
      "disappeared. Two weeks had passed since Martin had seen him, and he\n",
      "vainly cudgelled his brains for some cause of offence. The ten cents\n",
      "carried Martin across the ferry to San Francisco, and as he walked up\n",
      "Market Street he speculated upon his predicament in case he failed to\n",
      "collect the money. There would then be no way for him to return to\n",
      "Oakland, and he knew no one in San Francisco from whom to borrow\n",
      "another ten cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door to the _Transcontinental_ office was ajar, and Martin, in the\n",
      "act of opening it, was brought to a sudden pause by a loud voice from\n",
      "within, which exclaimed:- “But that is not the question, Mr. Ford.”\n",
      "(Ford, Martin knew, from his correspondence, to be the editor’s name.)\n",
      "“The question is, are you prepared to pay?—cash, and cash down, I mean?\n",
      "I am not interested in the prospects of the _Transcontinental_ and what\n",
      "you expect to make it next year. What I want is to be paid for what I\n",
      "do. And I tell you, right now, the Christmas _Transcontinental_ don’t\n",
      "go to press till I have the money in my hand. Good day. When you get\n",
      "the money, come and see me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The door jerked open, and the man flung past Martin, with an angry\n",
      "countenance and went down the corridor, muttering curses and clenching\n",
      "his fists. Martin decided not to enter immediately, and lingered in the\n",
      "hallways for a quarter of an hour. Then he shoved the door open and\n",
      "walked in. It was a new experience, the first time he had been inside\n",
      "an editorial office. Cards evidently were not necessary in that office,\n",
      "for the boy carried word to an inner room that there was a man who\n",
      "wanted to see Mr. Ford. Returning, the boy beckoned him from halfway\n",
      "across the room and led him to the private office, the editorial\n",
      "sanctum. Martin’s first impression was of the disorder and cluttered\n",
      "confusion of the room. Next he noticed a bewhiskered, youthful-looking\n",
      "man, sitting at a roll-top desk, who regarded him curiously. Martin\n",
      "marvelled at the calm repose of his face. It was evident that the\n",
      "squabble with the printer had not affected his equanimity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I—I am Martin Eden,” Martin began the conversation. (“And I want my\n",
      "five dollars,” was what he would have liked to say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was his first editor, and under the circumstances he did not\n",
      "desire to scare him too abruptly. To his surprise, Mr. Ford leaped into\n",
      "the air with a “You don’t say so!” and the next moment, with both\n",
      "hands, was shaking Martin’s hand effusively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t say how glad I am to see you, Mr. Eden. Often wondered what you\n",
      "were like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he held Martin off at arm’s length and ran his beaming eyes over\n",
      "Martin’s second-best suit, which was also his worst suit, and which was\n",
      "ragged and past repair, though the trousers showed the careful crease\n",
      "he had put in with Maria’s flat-irons.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I confess, though, I conceived you to be a much older man than you\n",
      "are. Your story, you know, showed such breadth, and vigor, such\n",
      "maturity and depth of thought. A masterpiece, that story—I knew it when\n",
      "I had read the first half-dozen lines. Let me tell you how I first read\n",
      "it. But no; first let me introduce you to the staff.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still talking, Mr. Ford led him into the general office, where he\n",
      "introduced him to the associate editor, Mr. White, a slender, frail\n",
      "little man whose hand seemed strangely cold, as if he were suffering\n",
      "from a chill, and whose whiskers were sparse and silky.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And Mr. Ends, Mr. Eden. Mr. Ends is our business manager, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin found himself shaking hands with a cranky-eyed, bald-headed man,\n",
      "whose face looked youthful enough from what little could be seen of it,\n",
      "for most of it was covered by a snow-white beard, carefully trimmed—by\n",
      "his wife, who did it on Sundays, at which times she also shaved the\n",
      "back of his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three men surrounded Martin, all talking admiringly and at once,\n",
      "until it seemed to him that they were talking against time for a wager.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We often wondered why you didn’t call,” Mr. White was saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t have the carfare, and I live across the Bay,” Martin answered\n",
      "bluntly, with the idea of showing them his imperative need for the\n",
      "money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, he thought to himself, my glad rags in themselves are eloquent\n",
      "advertisement of my need. Time and again, whenever opportunity offered,\n",
      "he hinted about the purpose of his business. But his admirers’ ears\n",
      "were deaf. They sang his praises, told him what they had thought of his\n",
      "story at first sight, what they subsequently thought, what their wives\n",
      "and families thought; but not one hint did they breathe of intention to\n",
      "pay him for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did I tell you how I first read your story?” Mr. Ford said. “Of course\n",
      "I didn’t. I was coming west from New York, and when the train stopped\n",
      "at Ogden, the train-boy on the new run brought aboard the current\n",
      "number of the _Transcontinental_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My God! Martin thought; you can travel in a Pullman while I starve for\n",
      "the paltry five dollars you owe me. A wave of anger rushed over him.\n",
      "The wrong done him by the _Transcontinental_ loomed colossal, for\n",
      "strong upon him were all the dreary months of vain yearning, of hunger\n",
      "and privation, and his present hunger awoke and gnawed at him,\n",
      "reminding him that he had eaten nothing since the day before, and\n",
      "little enough then. For the moment he saw red. These creatures were not\n",
      "even robbers. They were sneak-thieves. By lies and broken promises they\n",
      "had tricked him out of his story. Well, he would show them. And a great\n",
      "resolve surged into his will to the effect that he would not leave the\n",
      "office until he got his money. He remembered, if he did not get it,\n",
      "that there was no way for him to go back to Oakland. He controlled\n",
      "himself with an effort, but not before the wolfish expression of his\n",
      "face had awed and perturbed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They became more voluble than ever. Mr. Ford started anew to tell how\n",
      "he had first read “The Ring of Bells,” and Mr. Ends at the same time\n",
      "was striving to repeat his niece’s appreciation of “The Ring of Bells,”\n",
      "said niece being a school-teacher in Alameda.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you what I came for,” Martin said finally. “To be paid for\n",
      "that story all of you like so well. Five dollars, I believe, is what\n",
      "you promised me would be paid on publication.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ford, with an expression on his mobile features of mediate and\n",
      "happy acquiescence, started to reach for his pocket, then turned\n",
      "suddenly to Mr. Ends, and said that he had left his money home. That\n",
      "Mr. Ends resented this, was patent; and Martin saw the twitch of his\n",
      "arm as if to protect his trousers pocket. Martin knew that the money\n",
      "was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sorry,” said Mr. Ends, “but I paid the printer not an hour ago,\n",
      "and he took my ready change. It was careless of me to be so short; but\n",
      "the bill was not yet due, and the printer’s request, as a favor, to\n",
      "make an immediate advance, was quite unexpected.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both men looked expectantly at Mr. White, but that gentleman laughed\n",
      "and shrugged his shoulders. His conscience was clean at any rate. He\n",
      "had come into the _Transcontinental_ to learn magazine-literature,\n",
      "instead of which he had principally learned finance. The\n",
      "_Transcontinental_ owed him four months’ salary, and he knew that the\n",
      "printer must be appeased before the associate editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s rather absurd, Mr. Eden, to have caught us in this shape,” Mr.\n",
      "Ford preambled airily. “All carelessness, I assure you. But I’ll tell\n",
      "you what we’ll do. We’ll mail you a check the first thing in the\n",
      "morning. You have Mr. Eden’s address, haven’t you, Mr. Ends?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Mr. Ends had the address, and the check would be mailed the first\n",
      "thing in the morning. Martin’s knowledge of banks and checks was hazy,\n",
      "but he could see no reason why they should not give him the check on\n",
      "this day just as well as on the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it is understood, Mr. Eden, that we’ll mail you the check\n",
      "to-morrow?” Mr. Ford said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I need the money to-day,” Martin answered stolidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The unfortunate circumstances—if you had chanced here any other day,”\n",
      "Mr. Ford began suavely, only to be interrupted by Mr. Ends, whose\n",
      "cranky eyes justified themselves in his shortness of temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Ford has already explained the situation,” he said with asperity.\n",
      "“And so have I. The check will be mailed—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I also have explained,” Martin broke in, “and I have explained that I\n",
      "want the money to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had felt his pulse quicken a trifle at the business manager’s\n",
      "brusqueness, and upon him he kept an alert eye, for it was in that\n",
      "gentleman’s trousers pocket that he divined the _Transcontinental’s_\n",
      "ready cash was reposing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is too bad—” Mr. Ford began.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at that moment, with an impatient movement, Mr. Ends turned as if\n",
      "about to leave the room. At the same instant Martin sprang for him,\n",
      "clutching him by the throat with one hand in such fashion that Mr.\n",
      "Ends’ snow-white beard, still maintaining its immaculate trimness,\n",
      "pointed ceilingward at an angle of forty-five degrees. To the horror of\n",
      "Mr. White and Mr. Ford, they saw their business manager shaken like an\n",
      "Astrakhan rug.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dig up, you venerable discourager of rising young talent!” Martin\n",
      "exhorted. “Dig up, or I’ll shake it out of you, even if it’s all in\n",
      "nickels.” Then, to the two affrighted onlookers: “Keep away! If you\n",
      "interfere, somebody’s liable to get hurt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ends was choking, and it was not until the grip on his throat was\n",
      "eased that he was able to signify his acquiescence in the digging-up\n",
      "programme. All together, after repeated digs, its trousers pocket\n",
      "yielded four dollars and fifteen cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Inside out with it,” Martin commanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "An additional ten cents fell out. Martin counted the result of his raid\n",
      "a second time to make sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You next!” he shouted at Mr. Ford. “I want seventy-five cents more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Ford did not wait, but ransacked his pockets, with the result of\n",
      "sixty cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure that is all?” Martin demanded menacingly, possessing himself of\n",
      "it. “What have you got in your vest pockets?”\n",
      "\n",
      "In token of his good faith, Mr. Ford turned two of his pockets inside\n",
      "out. A strip of cardboard fell to the floor from one of them. He\n",
      "recovered it and was in the act of returning it, when Martin cried:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s that?—A ferry ticket? Here, give it to me. It’s worth ten\n",
      "cents. I’ll credit you with it. I’ve now got four dollars and\n",
      "ninety-five cents, including the ticket. Five cents is still due me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked fiercely at Mr. White, and found that fragile creature in the\n",
      "act of handing him a nickel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you,” Martin said, addressing them collectively. “I wish you a\n",
      "good day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Robber!” Mr. Ends snarled after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sneak-thief!” Martin retorted, slamming the door as he passed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin was elated—so elated that when he recollected that _The Hornet_\n",
      "owed him fifteen dollars for “The Peri and the Pearl,” he decided\n",
      "forthwith to go and collect it. But _The Hornet_ was run by a set of\n",
      "clean-shaven, strapping young men, frank buccaneers who robbed\n",
      "everything and everybody, not excepting one another. After some\n",
      "breakage of the office furniture, the editor (an ex-college athlete),\n",
      "ably assisted by the business manager, an advertising agent, and the\n",
      "porter, succeeded in removing Martin from the office and in\n",
      "accelerating, by initial impulse, his descent of the first flight of\n",
      "stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come again, Mr. Eden; glad to see you any time,” they laughed down at\n",
      "him from the landing above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin grinned as he picked himself up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Phew!” he murmured back. “The _Transcontinental_ crowd were\n",
      "nanny-goats, but you fellows are a lot of prize-fighters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "More laughter greeted this.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must say, Mr. Eden,” the editor of _The Hornet_ called down, “that\n",
      "for a poet you can go some yourself. Where did you learn that right\n",
      "cross—if I may ask?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where you learned that half-Nelson,” Martin answered. “Anyway, you’re\n",
      "going to have a black eye.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope your neck doesn’t stiffen up,” the editor wished solicitously:\n",
      "“What do you say we all go out and have a drink on it—not the neck, of\n",
      "course, but the little rough-house?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll go you if I lose,” Martin accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "And robbers and robbed drank together, amicably agreeing that the\n",
      "battle was to the strong, and that the fifteen dollars for “The Peri\n",
      "and the Pearl” belonged by right to _The Hornet’s_ editorial staff.\n",

      "\n",
      "Arthur remained at the gate while Ruth climbed Maria’s front steps. She\n",
      "heard the rapid click of the type-writer, and when Martin let her in,\n",
      "found him on the last page of a manuscript. She had come to make\n",
      "certain whether or not he would be at their table for Thanksgiving\n",
      "dinner; but before she could broach the subject Martin plunged into the\n",
      "one with which he was full.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here, let me read you this,” he cried, separating the carbon copies\n",
      "and running the pages of manuscript into shape. “It’s my latest, and\n",
      "different from anything I’ve done. It is so altogether different that I\n",
      "am almost afraid of it, and yet I’ve a sneaking idea it is good. You be\n",
      "judge. It’s an Hawaiian story. I’ve called it ‘Wiki-wiki.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "His face was bright with the creative glow, though she shivered in the\n",
      "cold room and had been struck by the coldness of his hands at greeting.\n",
      "She listened closely while he read, and though he from time to time had\n",
      "seen only disapprobation in her face, at the close he asked:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“Frankly, what do you think of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I—I don’t know,” she, answered. “Will it—do you think it will sell?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid not,” was the confession. “It’s too strong for the\n",
      "magazines. But it’s true, on my word it’s true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why do you persist in writing such things when you know they won’t\n",
      "sell?” she went on inexorably. “The reason for your writing is to make\n",
      "a living, isn’t it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that’s right; but the miserable story got away with me. I\n",
      "couldn’t help writing it. It demanded to be written.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that character, that Wiki-Wiki, why do you make him talk so\n",
      "roughly? Surely it will offend your readers, and surely that is why the\n",
      "editors are justified in refusing your work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because the real Wiki-Wiki would have talked that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is not good taste.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is life,” he replied bluntly. “It is real. It is true. And I must\n",
      "write life as I see it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She made no answer, and for an awkward moment they sat silent. It was\n",
      "because he loved her that he did not quite understand her, and she\n",
      "could not understand him because he was so large that he bulked beyond\n",
      "her horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’ve collected from the _Transcontinental_,” he said in an\n",
      "effort to shift the conversation to a more comfortable subject. The\n",
      "picture of the bewhiskered trio, as he had last seen them, mulcted of\n",
      "four dollars and ninety cents and a ferry ticket, made him chuckle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you’ll come!” she cried joyously. “That was what I came to find\n",
      "out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come?” he muttered absently. “Where?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, to dinner to-morrow. You know you said you’d recover your suit if\n",
      "you got that money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forgot all about it,” he said humbly. “You see, this morning the\n",
      "poundman got Maria’s two cows and the baby calf, and—well, it happened\n",
      "that Maria didn’t have any money, and so I had to recover her cows for\n",
      "her. That’s where the _Transcontinental_ fiver went—‘The Ring of Bells’\n",
      "went into the poundman’s pocket.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you won’t come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked down at his clothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears of disappointment and reproach glistened in her blue eyes, but\n",
      "she said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Next Thanksgiving you’ll have dinner with me in Delmonico’s,” he said\n",
      "cheerily; “or in London, or Paris, or anywhere you wish. I know it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw in the paper a few days ago,” she announced abruptly, “that\n",
      "there had been several local appointments to the Railway Mail. You\n",
      "passed first, didn’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was compelled to admit that the call had come for him, but that he\n",
      "had declined it. “I was so sure—I am so sure—of myself,” he concluded.\n",
      "“A year from now I’ll be earning more than a dozen men in the Railway\n",
      "Mail. You wait and see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” was all she said, when he finished. She stood up, pulling at her\n",
      "gloves. “I must go, Martin. Arthur is waiting for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took her in his arms and kissed her, but she proved a passive\n",
      "sweetheart. There was no tenseness in her body, her arms did not go\n",
      "around him, and her lips met his without their wonted pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was angry with him, he concluded, as he returned from the gate. But\n",
      "why? It was unfortunate that the poundman had gobbled Maria’s cows. But\n",
      "it was only a stroke of fate. Nobody could be blamed for it. Nor did it\n",
      "enter his head that he could have done aught otherwise than what he had\n",
      "done. Well, yes, he was to blame a little, was his next thought, for\n",
      "having refused the call to the Railway Mail. And she had not liked\n",
      "“Wiki-Wiki.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned at the head of the steps to meet the letter-carrier on his\n",
      "afternoon round. The ever recurrent fever of expectancy assailed Martin\n",
      "as he took the bundle of long envelopes. One was not long. It was short\n",
      "and thin, and outside was printed the address of _The New York\n",
      "Outview_. He paused in the act of tearing the envelope open. It could\n",
      "not be an acceptance. He had no manuscripts with that publication.\n",
      "Perhaps—his heart almost stood still at the—wild thought—perhaps they\n",
      "were ordering an article from him; but the next instant he dismissed\n",
      "the surmise as hopelessly impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a short, formal letter, signed by the office editor, merely\n",
      "informing him that an anonymous letter which they had received was\n",
      "enclosed, and that he could rest assured the _Outview’s_ staff never\n",
      "under any circumstances gave consideration to anonymous correspondence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enclosed letter Martin found to be crudely printed by hand. It was\n",
      "a hotchpotch of illiterate abuse of Martin, and of assertion that the\n",
      "“so-called Martin Eden” who was selling stories to magazines was no\n",
      "writer at all, and that in reality he was stealing stories from old\n",
      "magazines, typing them, and sending them out as his own. The envelope\n",
      "was postmarked “San Leandro.” Martin did not require a second thought\n",
      "to discover the author. Higginbotham’s grammar, Higginbotham’s\n",
      "colloquialisms, Higginbotham’s mental quirks and processes, were\n",
      "apparent throughout. Martin saw in every line, not the fine Italian\n",
      "hand, but the coarse grocer’s fist, of his brother-in-law.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why? he vainly questioned. What injury had he done Bernard\n",
      "Higginbotham? The thing was so unreasonable, so wanton. There was no\n",
      "explaining it. In the course of the week a dozen similar letters were\n",
      "forwarded to Martin by the editors of various Eastern magazines. The\n",
      "editors were behaving handsomely, Martin concluded. He was wholly\n",
      "unknown to them, yet some of them had even been sympathetic. It was\n",
      "evident that they detested anonymity. He saw that the malicious attempt\n",
      "to hurt him had failed. In fact, if anything came of it, it was bound\n",
      "to be good, for at least his name had been called to the attention of a\n",
      "number of editors. Sometime, perhaps, reading a submitted manuscript of\n",
      "his, they might remember him as the fellow about whom they had received\n",
      "an anonymous letter. And who was to say that such a remembrance might\n",
      "not sway the balance of their judgment just a trifle in his favor?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about this time that Martin took a great slump in Maria’s\n",
      "estimation. He found her in the kitchen one morning groaning with pain,\n",
      "tears of weakness running down her cheeks, vainly endeavoring to put\n",
      "through a large ironing. He promptly diagnosed her affliction as La\n",
      "Grippe, dosed her with hot whiskey (the remnants in the bottles for\n",
      "which Brissenden was responsible), and ordered her to bed. But Maria\n",
      "was refractory. The ironing had to be done, she protested, and\n",
      "delivered that night, or else there would be no food on the morrow for\n",
      "the seven small and hungry Silvas.\n",
      "\n",
      "To her astonishment (and it was something that she never ceased from\n",
      "relating to her dying day), she saw Martin Eden seize an iron from the\n",
      "stove and throw a fancy shirt-waist on the ironing-board. It was Kate\n",
      "Flanagan’s best Sunday waist, than whom there was no more exacting and\n",
      "fastidiously dressed woman in Maria’s world. Also, Miss Flanagan had\n",
      "sent special instruction that said waist must be delivered by that\n",
      "night. As every one knew, she was keeping company with John Collins,\n",
      "the blacksmith, and, as Maria knew privily, Miss Flanagan and Mr.\n",
      "Collins were going next day to Golden Gate Park. Vain was Maria’s\n",
      "attempt to rescue the garment. Martin guided her tottering footsteps to\n",
      "a chair, from where she watched him with bulging eyes. In a quarter of\n",
      "the time it would have taken her she saw the shirt-waist safely ironed,\n",
      "and ironed as well as she could have done it, as Martin made her grant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could work faster,” he explained, “if your irons were only hotter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To her, the irons he swung were much hotter than she ever dared to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your sprinkling is all wrong,” he complained next. “Here, let me teach\n",
      "you how to sprinkle. Pressure is what’s wanted. Sprinkle under pressure\n",
      "if you want to iron fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He procured a packing-case from the woodpile in the cellar, fitted a\n",
      "cover to it, and raided the scrap-iron the Silva tribe was collecting\n",
      "for the junkman. With fresh-sprinkled garments in the box, covered with\n",
      "the board and pressed by the iron, the device was complete and in\n",
      "operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now you watch me, Maria,” he said, stripping off to his undershirt and\n",
      "gripping an iron that was what he called “really hot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An’ when he feenish da iron’ he washa da wools,” as she described it\n",
      "afterward. “He say, ‘Maria, you are da greata fool. I showa you how to\n",
      "washa da wools,’ an’ he shows me, too. Ten minutes he maka da\n",
      "machine—one barrel, one wheel-hub, two poles, justa like dat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin had learned the contrivance from Joe at the Shelly Hot Springs.\n",
      "The old wheel-hub, fixed on the end of the upright pole, constituted\n",
      "the plunger. Making this, in turn, fast to the spring-pole attached to\n",
      "the kitchen rafters, so that the hub played upon the woollens in the\n",
      "barrel, he was able, with one hand, thoroughly to pound them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No more Maria washa da wools,” her story always ended. “I maka da kids\n",
      "worka da pole an’ da hub an’ da barrel. Him da smarta man, Mister\n",
      "Eden.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, by his masterly operation and improvement of her\n",
      "kitchen-laundry he fell an immense distance in her regard. The glamour\n",
      "of romance with which her imagination had invested him faded away in\n",
      "the cold light of fact that he was an ex-laundryman. All his books, and\n",
      "his grand friends who visited him in carriages or with countless\n",
      "bottles of whiskey, went for naught. He was, after all, a mere\n",
      "workingman, a member of her own class and caste. He was more human and\n",
      "approachable, but, he was no longer mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin’s alienation from his family continued. Following upon Mr.\n",
      "Higginbotham’s unprovoked attack, Mr. Hermann von Schmidt showed his\n",
      "hand. The fortunate sale of several storiettes, some humorous verse,\n",
      "and a few jokes gave Martin a temporary splurge of prosperity. Not only\n",

      "his future brother-in-law, he sent it to Von Schmidt’s shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The afternoon of the same day Martin was pleased by the wheel being\n",
      "delivered by a small boy. Von Schmidt was also inclined to be friendly,\n",

      "usually had to be called for. But when he examined the wheel, he\n",

      "Martin’s philosophy asserted itself, dissipating his anger, and he hung\n",
      "up the receiver with a long whistle of incredulous amusement. But after\n",
      "the amusement came the reaction, and he was oppressed by his\n",
      "loneliness. Nobody understood him, nobody seemed to have any use for\n",

      "leapt with joy. It was Brissenden, and in the fleeting glimpse, ere the\n",

      "\n",
      "Brissenden gave no explanation of his long absence, nor did Martin pry\n",
      "into it. He was content to see his friend’s cadaverous face opposite\n",
      "him through the steam rising from a tumbler of toddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I, too, have not been idle,” Brissenden proclaimed, after hearing\n",
      "Martin’s account of the work he had accomplished.\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled a manuscript from his inside coat pocket and passed it to\n",
      "Martin, who looked at the title and glanced up curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that’s it,” Brissenden laughed. “Pretty good title, eh?\n",
      "‘Ephemera’—it is the one word. And you’re responsible for it, what of\n",
      "your _man_, who is always the erected, the vitalized inorganic, the\n",
      "latest of the ephemera, the creature of temperature strutting his\n",
      "little space on the thermometer. It got into my head and I had to write\n",
      "it to get rid of it. Tell me what you think of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin’s face, flushed at first, paled as he read on. It was perfect\n",
      "art. Form triumphed over substance, if triumph it could be called where\n",
      "the last conceivable atom of substance had found expression in so\n",
      "perfect construction as to make Martin’s head swim with delight, to put\n",
      "passionate tears into his eyes, and to send chills creeping up and down\n",
      "his back. It was a long poem of six or seven hundred lines, and it was\n",
      "a fantastic, amazing, unearthly thing. It was terrific, impossible; and\n",
      "yet there it was, scrawled in black ink across the sheets of paper. It\n",
      "dealt with man and his soul-gropings in their ultimate terms, plumbing\n",
      "the abysses of space for the testimony of remotest suns and rainbow\n",
      "spectrums. It was a mad orgy of imagination, wassailing in the skull of\n",
      "a dying man who half sobbed under his breath and was quick with the\n",
      "wild flutter of fading heart-beats. The poem swung in majestic rhythm\n",
      "to the cool tumult of interstellar conflict, to the onset of starry\n",
      "hosts, to the impact of cold suns and the flaming up of nebulae in the\n",
      "darkened void; and through it all, unceasing and faint, like a silver\n",
      "shuttle, ran the frail, piping voice of man, a querulous chirp amid the\n",
      "screaming of planets and the crash of systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is nothing like it in literature,” Martin said, when at last he\n",
      "was able to speak. “It’s wonderful!—wonderful! It has gone to my head.\n",
      "I am drunken with it. That great, infinitesimal question—I can’t shake\n",
      "it out of my thoughts. That questing, eternal, ever recurring, thin\n",
      "little wailing voice of man is still ringing in my ears. It is like the\n",
      "dead-march of a gnat amid the trumpeting of elephants and the roaring\n",
      "of lions. It is insatiable with microscopic desire. I now I’m making a\n",
      "fool of myself, but the thing has obsessed me. You are—I don’t know\n",
      "what you are—you are wonderful, that’s all. But how do you do it? How\n",

      "\n",
      "“I shall never write again. I am a dauber in clay. You have shown me\n",
      "the work of the real artificer-artisan. Genius! This is something more\n",
      "than genius. It transcends genius. It is truth gone mad. It is true,\n",
      "man, every line of it. I wonder if you realize that, you dogmatist.\n",
      "Science cannot give you the lie. It is the truth of the sneer, stamped\n",
      "out from the black iron of the Cosmos and interwoven with mighty\n",

      "\n",
      "“I know nothing of the sort. I know there’s not a magazine in\n",
      "Christendom that wouldn’t jump at it. They don’t get things like that\n",
      "every day. That’s no mere poem of the year. It’s the poem of the\n",

      "or second offering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s just one thing that prevents me from taking you.” Brissenden\n",
      "waited a moment. “The thing is big—the biggest I’ve ever done. I know\n",
      "that. It’s my swan song. I am almighty proud of it. I worship it. It’s\n",
      "better than whiskey. It is what I dreamed of—the great and perfect\n",
      "thing—when I was a simple young man, with sweet illusions and clean\n",
      "ideals. And I’ve got it, now, in my last grasp, and I’ll not have it\n",
      "pawed over and soiled by a lot of swine. No, I won’t take the bet. It’s\n",
      "mine. I made it, and I’ve shared it with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But think of the rest of the world,” Martin protested. “The function\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I’m not selfish.” Brissenden grinned soberly in the way he had when\n",

      "unselfish as a famished hog.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain Martin strove to shake him from his decision. Martin told him\n",
      "that his hatred of the magazines was rabid, fanatical, and that his\n",
      "conduct was a thousand times more despicable than that of the youth who\n",
      "burned the temple of Diana at Ephesus. Under the storm of denunciation\n",
      "Brissenden complacently sipped his toddy and affirmed that everything\n",
      "the other said was quite true, with the exception of the magazine\n",
      "editors. His hatred of them knew no bounds, and he excelled Martin in\n",
      "denunciation when he turned upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish you’d type it for me,” he said. “You know how a thousand times\n",
      "better than any stenographer. And now I want to give you some advice.”\n",
      "He drew a bulky manuscript from his outside coat pocket. “Here’s your\n",
      "‘Shame of the Sun.’ I’ve read it not once, but twice and three\n",
      "times—the highest compliment I can pay you. After what you’ve said\n",
      "about ‘Ephemera’ I must be silent. But this I will say: when ‘The Shame\n",
      "of the Sun’ is published, it will make a hit. It will start a\n",
      "controversy that will be worth thousands to you just in advertising.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin laughed. “I suppose your next advice will be to submit it to the\n",

      "\n",
      "“By all means no—that is, if you want to see it in print. Offer it to\n",
      "the first-class houses. Some publisher’s reader may be mad enough or\n",
      "drunk enough to report favorably on it. You’ve read the books. The meat\n",
      "of them has been transmuted in the alembic of Martin Eden’s mind and\n",
      "poured into ‘The Shame of the Sun,’ and one day Martin Eden will be\n",
      "famous, and not the least of his fame will rest upon that work. So you\n",
      "must get a publisher for it—the sooner the better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brissenden went home late that night; and just as he mounted the first\n",
      "step of the car, he swung suddenly back on Martin and thrust into his\n",
      "hand a small, tightly crumpled wad of paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here, take this,” he said. “I was out to the races to-day, and I had\n",
      "the right dope.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The bell clanged and the car pulled out, leaving Martin wondering as to\n",
      "the nature of the crinkly, greasy wad he clutched in his hand. Back in\n",
      "his room he unrolled it and found a hundred-dollar bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not scruple to use it. He knew his friend had always plenty of\n",
      "money, and he knew also, with profound certitude, that his success\n",
      "would enable him to repay it. In the morning he paid every bill, gave\n",
      "Maria three months’ advance on the room, and redeemed every pledge at\n",
      "the pawnshop. Next he bought Marian’s wedding present, and simpler\n",
      "presents, suitable to Christmas, for Ruth and Gertrude. And finally, on\n",
      "the balance remaining to him, he herded the whole Silva tribe down into\n",
      "Oakland. He was a winter late in redeeming his promise, but redeemed it\n",
      "was, for the last, least Silva got a pair of shoes, as well as Maria\n",
      "herself. Also, there were horns, and dolls, and toys of various sorts,\n",
      "and parcels and bundles of candies and nuts that filled the arms of all\n",
      "the Silvas to overflowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was with this extraordinary procession trooping at his and Maria’s\n",
      "heels into a confectioner’s in quest of the biggest candy-cane ever\n",
      "made, that he encountered Ruth and her mother. Mrs. Morse was shocked.\n",
      "Even Ruth was hurt, for she had some regard for appearances, and her\n",
      "lover, cheek by jowl with Maria, at the head of that army of Portuguese\n",
      "ragamuffins, was not a pretty sight. But it was not that which hurt so\n",
      "much as what she took to be his lack of pride and self-respect.\n",
      "Further, and keenest of all, she read into the incident the\n",
      "impossibility of his living down his working-class origin. There was\n",
      "stigma enough in the fact of it, but shamelessly to flaunt it in the\n",
      "face of the world—her world—was going too far. Though her engagement to\n",
      "Martin had been kept secret, their long intimacy had not been\n",
      "unproductive of gossip; and in the shop, glancing covertly at her lover\n",
      "and his following, had been several of her acquaintances. She lacked\n",
      "the easy largeness of Martin and could not rise superior to her\n",
      "environment. She had been hurt to the quick, and her sensitive nature\n",
      "was quivering with the shame of it. So it was, when Martin arrived\n",
      "later in the day, that he kept her present in his breast-pocket,\n",
      "deferring the giving of it to a more propitious occasion. Ruth in\n",
      "tears—passionate, angry tears—was a revelation to him. The spectacle of\n",
      "her suffering convinced him that he had been a brute, yet in the soul\n",
      "of him he could not see how nor why. It never entered his head to be\n",
      "ashamed of those he knew, and to take the Silvas out to a Christmas\n",
      "treat could in no way, so it seemed to him, show lack of consideration\n",
      "for Ruth. On the other hand, he did see Ruth’s point of view, after she\n",
      "had explained it; and he looked upon it as a feminine weakness, such as\n",
      "afflicted all women and the best of women.\n",

      "evening in January.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had dined together in San Francisco, and were at the Ferry\n",
      "Building, returning to Oakland, when the whim came to him to show\n",
      "Martin the “real dirt.” He turned and fled across the water-front, a\n",
      "meagre shadow in a flapping overcoat, with Martin straining to keep up\n",
      "with him. At a wholesale liquor store he bought two gallon-demijohns of\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Men, intelligent men, and not the gibbering nonentities I found you\n",
      "consorting with in that trader’s den. You read the books and you found\n",
      "yourself all alone. Well, I’m going to show you to-night some other men\n",

      "\n",
      "“Hope Norton’s there,” he panted a little later, resisting Martin’s\n",
      "effort to relieve him of the two demijohns. “Norton’s an idealist—a\n",
      "Harvard man. Prodigious memory. Idealism led him to philosophic\n",
      "anarchy, and his family threw him off. Father’s a railroad president\n",
      "and many times millionnaire, but the son’s starving in ’Frisco, editing\n",
      "an anarchist sheet for twenty-five a month.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“Strawn-Hamilton’s his name—hyphenated, you know—comes of old Southern\n",
      "stock. He’s a tramp—laziest man I ever knew, though he’s clerking, or\n",
      "trying to, in a socialist coöperative store for six dollars a week. But\n",
      "he’s a confirmed hobo. Tramped into town. I’ve seen him sit all day on\n",
      "a bench and never a bite pass his lips, and in the evening, when I\n",
      "invited him to dinner—restaurant two blocks away—have him say, ‘Too\n",

      "a Spencerian like you till Kreis turned him to materialistic monism.\n",
      "I’ll start him on monism if I can. Norton’s another monist—only he\n",

      "Unscrupulous. Rob a corpse of a shroud—anything. Difference between him\n",

      "Nietzsche, or Schopenhauer, or Kant, or anything, but the only thing in\n",
      "this world, not excepting Mary, that he really cares for, is his\n",

      "“Here’s the hang-out.” Brissenden rested his demijohn at the upstairs\n",

      "dazzling white teeth, a drooping black mustache, and large, flashing\n",
      "black eyes. Mary, a matronly young blonde, was washing dishes in the\n",
      "little back room that served for kitchen and dining room. The front\n",

      "witty and clever, they were not superficial. He swiftly saw, no matter\n",

      "all rebels of one variety or another, and their lips were strangers to\n",
      "platitudes. Never had Martin, at the Morses’, heard so amazing a range\n",
      "of topics discussed. There seemed no limit save time to the things they\n",

      "never encountered in the few women he had met. They talked together on\n",
      "Swinburne and Rossetti, after which she led him beyond his depth into\n",
      "the by-paths of French literature. His revenge came when she defended\n",

      "sneered back at them as metaphysicians. _Phenomenon_ and _noumenon_\n",
      "were bandied back and forth. They charged him with attempting to\n",
      "explain consciousness by itself. He charged them with word-jugglery,\n",
      "with reasoning from words to theory instead of from facts to theory. At\n",

      "application of which they immediately claimed for every reasoning\n",

      "\n",

      "clutching his chair to keep from jumping to his feet, his gray eyes\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing Martin did next morning was to go counter both to\n",
      "Brissenden’s advice and command. “The Shame of the Sun” he wrapped and\n",
      "mailed to _The Acropolis_. He believed he could find magazine\n",
      "publication for it, and he felt that recognition by the magazines would\n",
      "commend him to the book-publishing houses. “Ephemera” he likewise\n",
      "wrapped and mailed to a magazine. Despite Brissenden’s prejudice\n",
      "against the magazines, which was a pronounced mania with him, Martin\n",
      "decided that the great poem should see print. He did not intend,\n",
      "however, to publish it without the other’s permission. His plan was to\n",
      "get it accepted by one of the high magazines, and, thus armed, again to\n",
      "wrestle with Brissenden for consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin began, that morning, a story which he had sketched out a number\n",
      "of weeks before and which ever since had been worrying him with its\n",
      "insistent clamor to be created. Apparently it was to be a rattling sea\n",
      "story, a tale of twentieth-century adventure and romance, handling real\n",
      "characters, in a real world, under real conditions. But beneath the\n",
      "swing and go of the story was to be something else—something that the\n",
      "superficial reader would never discern and which, on the other hand,\n",
      "would not diminish in any way the interest and enjoyment for such a\n",
      "reader. It was this, and not the mere story, that impelled Martin to\n",
      "write it. For that matter, it was always the great, universal motif\n",
      "that suggested plots to him. After having found such a motif, he cast\n",
      "about for the particular persons and particular location in time and\n",
      "space wherewith and wherein to utter the universal thing. “Overdue” was\n",
      "the title he had decided for it, and its length he believed would not\n",
      "be more than sixty thousand words—a bagatelle for him with his splendid\n",
      "vigor of production. On this first day he took hold of it with\n",
      "conscious delight in the mastery of his tools. He no longer worried for\n",
      "fear that the sharp, cutting edges should slip and mar his work. The\n",
      "long months of intense application and study had brought their reward.\n",
      "He could now devote himself with sure hand to the larger phases of the\n",
      "thing he shaped; and as he worked, hour after hour, he felt, as never\n",
      "before, the sure and cosmic grasp with which he held life and the\n",
      "affairs of life. “Overdue” would tell a story that would be true of its\n",
      "particular characters and its particular events; but it would tell,\n",
      "too, he was confident, great vital things that would be true of all\n",
      "time, and all sea, and all life—thanks to Herbert Spencer, he thought,\n",
      "leaning back for a moment from the table. Ay, thanks to Herbert Spencer\n",
      "and to the master-key of life, evolution, which Spencer had placed in\n",
      "his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was conscious that it was great stuff he was writing. “It will go!\n",
      "It will go!” was the refrain that kept sounding in his ears. Of course\n",
      "it would go. At last he was turning out the thing at which the\n",
      "magazines would jump. The whole story worked out before him in\n",
      "lightning flashes. He broke off from it long enough to write a\n",
      "paragraph in his note-book. This would be the last paragraph in\n",
      "“Overdue”; but so thoroughly was the whole book already composed in his\n",
      "brain that he could write, weeks before he had arrived at the end, the\n",
      "end itself. He compared the tale, as yet unwritten, with the tales of\n",
      "the sea-writers, and he felt it to be immeasurably superior. “There’s\n",
      "only one man who could touch it,” he murmured aloud, “and that’s\n",
      "Conrad. And it ought to make even him sit up and shake hands with me,\n",
      "and say, ‘Well done, Martin, my boy.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "He toiled on all day, recollecting, at the last moment, that he was to\n",
      "have dinner at the Morses’. Thanks to Brissenden, his black suit was\n",
      "out of pawn and he was again eligible for dinner parties. Down town he\n",
      "stopped off long enough to run into the library and search for\n",
      "Saleeby’s books. He drew out “The Cycle of Life,” and on the car turned\n",
      "to the essay Norton had mentioned on Spencer. As Martin read, he grew\n",
      "angry. His face flushed, his jaw set, and unconsciously his hand\n",
      "clenched, unclenched, and clenched again as if he were taking fresh\n",
      "grips upon some hateful thing out of which he was squeezing the life.\n",
      "When he left the car, he strode along the sidewalk as a wrathful man\n",
      "will stride, and he rang the Morse bell with such viciousness that it\n",
      "roused him to consciousness of his condition, so that he entered in\n",
      "good nature, smiling with amusement at himself. No sooner, however, was\n",
      "he inside than a great depression descended upon him. He fell from the\n",
      "height where he had been up-borne all day on the wings of inspiration.\n",
      "“Bourgeois,” “trader’s den”—Brissenden’s epithets repeated themselves\n",
      "in his mind. But what of that? he demanded angrily. He was marrying\n",
      "Ruth, not her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to him that he had never seen Ruth more beautiful, more\n",
      "spiritual and ethereal and at the same time more healthy. There was\n",
      "color in her cheeks, and her eyes drew him again and again—the eyes in\n",
      "which he had first read immortality. He had forgotten immortality of\n",
      "late, and the trend of his scientific reading had been away from it;\n",
      "but here, in Ruth’s eyes, he read an argument without words that\n",
      "transcended all worded arguments. He saw that in her eyes before which\n",
      "all discussion fled away, for he saw love there. And in his own eyes\n",
      "was love; and love was unanswerable. Such was his passionate doctrine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The half hour he had with her, before they went in to dinner, left him\n",
      "supremely happy and supremely satisfied with life. Nevertheless, at\n",
      "table, the inevitable reaction and exhaustion consequent upon the hard\n",
      "day seized hold of him. He was aware that his eyes were tired and that\n",
      "he was irritable. He remembered it was at this table, at which he now\n",
      "sneered and was so often bored, that he had first eaten with civilized\n",
      "beings in what he had imagined was an atmosphere of high culture and\n",
      "refinement. He caught a glimpse of that pathetic figure of him, so long\n",
      "ago, a self-conscious savage, sprouting sweat at every pore in an agony\n",
      "of apprehension, puzzled by the bewildering minutiae of\n",
      "eating-implements, tortured by the ogre of a servant, striving at a\n",
      "leap to live at such dizzy social altitude, and deciding in the end to\n",
      "be frankly himself, pretending no knowledge and no polish he did not\n",
      "possess.\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced at Ruth for reassurance, much in the same manner that a\n",
      "passenger, with sudden panic thought of possible shipwreck, will strive\n",
      "to locate the life preservers. Well, that much had come out of it—love\n",
      "and Ruth. All the rest had failed to stand the test of the books. But\n",
      "Ruth and love had stood the test; for them he found a biological\n",
      "sanction. Love was the most exalted expression of life. Nature had been\n",
      "busy designing him, as she had been busy with all normal men, for the\n",
      "purpose of loving. She had spent ten thousand centuries—ay, a hundred\n",
      "thousand and a million centuries—upon the task, and he was the best she\n",
      "could do. She had made love the strongest thing in him, increased its\n",
      "power a myriad per cent with her gift of imagination, and sent him\n",
      "forth into the ephemera to thrill and melt and mate. His hand sought\n",
      "Ruth’s hand beside him hidden by the table, and a warm pressure was\n",
      "given and received. She looked at him a swift instant, and her eyes\n",
      "were radiant and melting. So were his in the thrill that pervaded him;\n",
      "nor did he realize how much that was radiant and melting in her eyes\n",
      "had been aroused by what she had seen in his.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the table from him, cater-cornered, at Mr. Morse’s right, sat\n",
      "Judge Blount, a local superior court judge. Martin had met him a number\n",
      "of times and had failed to like him. He and Ruth’s father were\n",
      "discussing labor union politics, the local situation, and socialism,\n",
      "and Mr. Morse was endeavoring to twit Martin on the latter topic. At\n",
      "last Judge Blount looked across the table with benignant and fatherly\n",
      "pity. Martin smiled to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll grow out of it, young man,” he said soothingly. “Time is the\n",
      "best cure for such youthful distempers.” He turned to Mr. Morse. “I do\n",
      "not believe discussion is good in such cases. It makes the patient\n",
      "obstinate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is true,” the other assented gravely. “But it is well to warn the\n",
      "patient occasionally of his condition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin laughed merrily, but it was with an effort. The day had been too\n",
      "long, the day’s effort too intense, and he was deep in the throes of\n",
      "the reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Undoubtedly you are both excellent doctors,” he said; “but if you care\n",
      "a whit for the opinion of the patient, let him tell you that you are\n",
      "poor diagnosticians. In fact, you are both suffering from the disease\n",
      "you think you find in me. As for me, I am immune. The socialist\n",
      "philosophy that riots half-baked in your veins has passed me by.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Out of your mouth.” Martin’s eyes were sparkling, but he kept control\n",
      "of himself. “You see, Judge, I’ve heard your campaign speeches. By some\n",
      "henidical process—henidical, by the way is a favorite word of mine\n",
      "which nobody understands—by some henidical process you persuade\n",
      "yourself that you believe in the competitive system and the survival of\n",

      "against the lordly handful of men who had ruled over them and would\n",
      "rule over them to the end of time. To Martin this withered wisp of a\n",
      "creature was a symbol. He was the figure that stood forth\n",
      "representative of the whole miserable mass of weaklings and\n",
      "inefficients who perished according to biological law on the ragged\n",
      "confines of life. They were the unfit. In spite of their cunning\n",

      "life she flung from her prolific hand she selected only the best. It\n",

      "He had caught their interest, and the audience urged the chairman by\n",
      "acclamation to extend Martin’s time. They appreciated him as a foeman\n",
      "worthy of their intellect, and they listened intently, following every\n",
      "word. He spoke with fire and conviction, mincing no words in his attack\n",
      "upon the slaves and their morality and tactics and frankly alluding to\n",
      "his hearers as the slaves in question. He quoted Spencer and Malthus,\n",

      "have as much as he wants to eat as many times a day as he desires, and\n",
      "where all will marry and have progeny—the weak as well as the strong.\n",
      "What will be the result? No longer will the strength and life-value of\n",
      "each generation increase. On the contrary, it will diminish. There is\n",
      "the Nemesis of your slave philosophy. Your society of slaves—of, by,\n",

      "“But to return. I have shown that no society of slaves can endure,\n",

      "The cub reporter was a trifle perplexed by this talking over him and\n",

      "get a personal interview with Martin Eden, the leader of the organized\n",
      "menace to society.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do not object to having your picture taken, Mr. Eden?” he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "“I guess I’m getting old,” was the answer. “I know I ought, but I\n",
      "really haven’t the heart. It doesn’t seem to matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For his mother’s sake,” Brissenden urged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s worth considering,” Martin replied; “but it doesn’t seem worth\n",
      "while enough to rouse sufficient energy in me. You see, it does take\n",
      "energy to give a fellow a poking. Besides, what does it matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s right—that’s the way to take it,” the cub announced airily,\n",
      "though he had already begun to glance anxiously at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it wasn’t true, not a word of what he wrote,” Martin went on,\n",

      "\n",
      "“It was just in a general way a description, you understand,” the cub\n",
      "ventured, “and besides, it’s good advertising. That’s what counts. It\n",
      "was a favor to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s good advertising, Martin, old boy,” Brissenden repeated solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And it was a favor to me—think of that!” was Martin’s contribution.\n",

      "“Let me see—where were you born, Mr. Eden?” the cub asked, assuming an\n",
      "air of expectant attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He doesn’t take notes,” said Brissenden. “He remembers it all.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“No decent reporter needs to bother with notes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was sufficient—for last night.” But Brissenden was not a disciple\n",
      "of quietism, and he changed his attitude abruptly. “Martin, if you\n",
      "don’t poke him, I’ll do it myself, if I fall dead on the floor the next\n",
      "moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How will a spanking do?” Martin asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brissenden considered judicially, and nodded his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next instant Martin was seated on the edge of the bed with the cub\n",
      "face downward across his knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now don’t bite,” Martin warned, “or else I’ll have to punch your face.\n",
      "It would be a pity, for it is such a pretty face.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His uplifted hand descended, and thereafter rose and fell in a swift\n",
      "and steady rhythm. The cub struggled and cursed and squirmed, but did\n",
      "not offer to bite. Brissenden looked on gravely, though once he grew\n",
      "excited and gripped the whiskey bottle, pleading, “Here, just let me\n",
      "swat him once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sorry my hand played out,” Martin said, when at last he desisted. “It\n",
      "is quite numb.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He uprighted the cub and perched him on the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll have you arrested for this,” he snarled, tears of boyish\n",
      "indignation running down his flushed cheeks. “I’ll make you sweat for\n",
      "this. You’ll see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The pretty thing,” Martin remarked. “He doesn’t realize that he has\n",
      "entered upon the downward path. It is not honest, it is not square, it\n",
      "is not manly, to tell lies about one’s fellow-creatures the way he has\n",
      "done, and he doesn’t know it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has to come to us to be told,” Brissenden filled in a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, to me whom he has maligned and injured. My grocery will\n",
      "undoubtedly refuse me credit now. The worst of it is that the poor boy\n",
      "will keep on this way until he deteriorates into a first-class\n",
      "newspaper man and also a first-class scoundrel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there is yet time,” quoth Brissenden. “Who knows but what you may\n",
      "prove the humble instrument to save him. Why didn’t you let me swat him\n",
      "just once? I’d like to have had a hand in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll have you arrested, the pair of you, you b-b-big brutes,” sobbed\n",
      "the erring soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, his mouth is too pretty and too weak.” Martin shook his head\n",
      "lugubriously. “I’m afraid I’ve numbed my hand in vain. The young man\n",
      "cannot reform. He will become eventually a very great and successful\n",
      "newspaper man. He has no conscience. That alone will make him great.”\n",

      "\n",
      "In the next morning’s paper Martin learned a great deal more about\n",
      "himself that was new to him. “We are the sworn enemies of society,” he\n",
      "found himself quoted as saying in a column interview. “No, we are not\n",
      "anarchists but socialists.” When the reporter pointed out to him that\n",
      "there seemed little difference between the two schools, Martin had\n",
      "shrugged his shoulders in silent affirmation. His face was described as\n",
      "bilaterally asymmetrical, and various other signs of degeneration were\n",
      "described. Especially notable were his thuglike hands and the fiery\n",
      "gleams in his blood-shot eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He learned, also, that he spoke nightly to the workmen in the City Hall\n",
      "Park, and that among the anarchists and agitators that there inflamed\n",
      "the minds of the people he drew the largest audiences and made the most\n",
      "revolutionary speeches. The cub painted a high-light picture of his\n",
      "poor little room, its oil-stove and the one chair, and of the\n",
      "death’s-head tramp who kept him company and who looked as if he had\n",
      "just emerged from twenty years of solitary confinement in some fortress\n",
      "dungeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cub had been industrious. He had scurried around and nosed out\n",
      "Martin’s family history, and procured a photograph of Higginbotham’s\n",
      "Cash Store with Bernard Higginbotham himself standing out in front.\n",
      "That gentleman was depicted as an intelligent, dignified businessman\n",
      "who had no patience with his brother-in-law’s socialistic views, and no\n",
      "patience with the brother-in-law, either, whom he was quoted as\n",
      "characterizing as a lazy good-for-nothing who wouldn’t take a job when\n",
      "it was offered to him and who would go to jail yet. Hermann von\n",
      "Schmidt, Marian’s husband, had likewise been interviewed. He had called\n",
      "Martin the black sheep of the family and repudiated him. “He tried to\n",
      "sponge off of me, but I put a stop to that good and quick,” Von Schmidt\n",
      "had said to the reporter. “He knows better than to come bumming around\n",
      "here. A man who won’t work is no good, take that from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This time Martin was genuinely angry. Brissenden looked upon the affair\n",
      "as a good joke, but he could not console Martin, who knew that it would\n",
      "be no easy task to explain to Ruth. As for her father, he knew that he\n",
      "must be overjoyed with what had happened and that he would make the\n",
      "most of it to break off the engagement. How much he would make of it he\n",
      "was soon to realize. The afternoon mail brought a letter from Ruth.\n",
      "Martin opened it with a premonition of disaster, and read it standing\n",
      "at the open door when he had received it from the postman. As he read,\n",
      "mechanically his hand sought his pocket for the tobacco and brown paper\n",
      "of his old cigarette days. He was not aware that the pocket was empty\n",
      "or that he had even reached for the materials with which to roll a\n",
      "cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a passionate letter. There were no touches of anger in it.\n",
      "But all the way through, from the first sentence to the last, was\n",
      "sounded the note of hurt and disappointment. She had expected better of\n",
      "him. She had thought he had got over his youthful wildness, that her\n",
      "love for him had been sufficiently worth while to enable him to live\n",
      "seriously and decently. And now her father and mother had taken a firm\n",
      "stand and commanded that the engagement be broken. That they were\n",
      "justified in this she could not but admit. Their relation could never\n",
      "be a happy one. It had been unfortunate from the first. But one regret\n",
      "she voiced in the whole letter, and it was a bitter one to Martin. “If\n",
      "only you had settled down to some position and attempted to make\n",
      "something of yourself,” she wrote. “But it was not to be. Your past\n",
      "life had been too wild and irregular. I can understand that you are not\n",
      "to be blamed. You could act only according to your nature and your\n",
      "early training. So I do not blame you, Martin. Please remember that. It\n",
      "was simply a mistake. As father and mother have contended, we were not\n",
      "made for each other, and we should both be happy because it was\n",
      "discovered not too late.” . . “There is no use trying to see me,” she\n",
      "said toward the last. “It would be an unhappy meeting for both of us,\n",
      "as well as for my mother. I feel, as it is, that I have caused her\n",
      "great pain and worry. I shall have to do much living to atone for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He read it through to the end, carefully, a second time, then sat down\n",
      "and replied. He outlined the remarks he had uttered at the socialist\n",
      "meeting, pointing out that they were in all ways the converse of what\n",
      "the newspaper had put in his mouth. Toward the end of the letter he was\n",
      "God’s own lover pleading passionately for love. “Please answer,” he\n",
      "said, “and in your answer you have to tell me but one thing. Do you\n",
      "love me? That is all—the answer to that one question.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But no answer came the next day, nor the next. “Overdue” lay untouched\n",
      "upon the table, and each day the heap of returned manuscripts under the\n",
      "table grew larger. For the first time Martin’s glorious sleep was\n",
      "interrupted by insomnia, and he tossed through long, restless nights.\n",
      "Three times he called at the Morse home, but was turned away by the\n",
      "servant who answered the bell. Brissenden lay sick in his hotel, too\n",
      "feeble to stir out, and, though Martin was with him often, he did not\n",
      "worry him with his troubles.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Martin’s troubles were many. The aftermath of the cub reporter’s\n",
      "deed was even wider than Martin had anticipated. The Portuguese grocer\n",
      "refused him further credit, while the greengrocer, who was an American\n",
      "and proud of it, had called him a traitor to his country and refused\n",
      "further dealings with him—carrying his patriotism to such a degree that\n",
      "he cancelled Martin’s account and forbade him ever to attempt to pay\n",
      "it. The talk in the neighborhood reflected the same feeling, and\n",
      "indignation against Martin ran high. No one would have anything to do\n",
      "with a socialist traitor. Poor Maria was dubious and frightened, but\n",
      "she remained loyal. The children of the neighborhood recovered from the\n",
      "awe of the grand carriage which once had visited Martin, and from safe\n",
      "distances they called him “hobo” and “bum.” The Silva tribe, however,\n",
      "stanchly defended him, fighting more than one pitched battle for his\n",
      "honor, and black eyes and bloody noses became quite the order of the\n",
      "day and added to Maria’s perplexities and troubles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, Martin met Gertrude on the street, down in Oakland, and learned\n",
      "what he knew could not be otherwise—that Bernard Higginbotham was\n",
      "furious with him for having dragged the family into public disgrace,\n",
      "and that he had forbidden him the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t you go away, Martin?” Gertrude had begged. “Go away and get\n",
      "a job somewhere and steady down. Afterwards, when this all blows over,\n",
      "you can come back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin shook his head, but gave no explanations. How could he explain?\n",
      "He was appalled at the awful intellectual chasm that yawned between him\n",
      "and his people. He could never cross it and explain to them his\n",
      "position,—the Nietzschean position, in regard to socialism. There were\n",
      "not words enough in the English language, nor in any language, to make\n",
      "his attitude and conduct intelligible to them. Their highest concept of\n",
      "right conduct, in his case, was to get a job. That was their first word\n",
      "and their last. It constituted their whole lexicon of ideas. Get a job!\n",
      "Go to work! Poor, stupid slaves, he thought, while his sister talked.\n",
      "Small wonder the world belonged to the strong. The slaves were obsessed\n",
      "by their own slavery. A job was to them a golden fetich before which\n",
      "they fell down and worshipped.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head again, when Gertrude offered him money, though he\n",
      "knew that within the day he would have to make a trip to the\n",
      "pawnbroker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t come near Bernard now,” she admonished him. “After a few months,\n",
      "when he is cooled down, if you want to, you can get the job of drivin’\n",
      "delivery-wagon for him. Any time you want me, just send for me an’ I’ll\n",
      "come. Don’t forget.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She went away weeping audibly, and he felt a pang of sorrow shoot\n",
      "through him at sight of her heavy body and uncouth gait. As he watched\n",
      "her go, the Nietzschean edifice seemed to shake and totter. The\n",
      "slave-class in the abstract was all very well, but it was not wholly\n",
      "satisfactory when it was brought home to his own family. And yet, if\n",
      "there was ever a slave trampled by the strong, that slave was his\n",
      "sister Gertrude. He grinned savagely at the paradox. A fine\n",
      "Nietzsche-man he was, to allow his intellectual concepts to be shaken\n",
      "by the first sentiment or emotion that strayed along—ay, to be shaken\n",
      "by the slave-morality itself, for that was what his pity for his sister\n",
      "really was. The true noble men were above pity and compassion. Pity and\n",
      "compassion had been generated in the subterranean barracoons of the\n",

      "\n",
      "“Overdue” still continued to lie forgotten on the table. Every\n",
      "manuscript that he had had out now lay under the table. Only one\n",
      "manuscript he kept going, and that was Brissenden’s “Ephemera.” His\n",
      "bicycle and black suit were again in pawn, and the type-writer people\n",
      "were once more worrying about the rent. But such things no longer\n",
      "bothered him. He was seeking a new orientation, and until that was\n",
      "found his life must stand still.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several weeks, what he had been waiting for happened. He met Ruth\n",
      "on the street. It was true, she was accompanied by her brother, Norman,\n",
      "and it was true that they tried to ignore him and that Norman attempted\n",
      "to wave him aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you interfere with my sister, I’ll call an officer,” Norman\n",
      "threatened. “She does not wish to speak with you, and your insistence\n",

      "\n",
      "“If you persist, you’ll have to call that officer, and then you’ll get\n",
      "your name in the papers,” Martin answered grimly. “And now, get out of\n",
      "my way and get the officer if you want to. I’m going to talk with\n",
      "Ruth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to have it from your own lips,” he said to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was pale and trembling, but she held up and looked inquiringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The question I asked in my letter,” he prompted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Norman made an impatient movement, but Martin checked him with a swift\n",

      "\n",
      "She shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is all this of your own free will?” he demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is.” She spoke in a low, firm voice and with deliberation. “It is\n",
      "of my own free will. You have disgraced me so that I am ashamed to meet\n",
      "my friends. They are all talking about me, I know. That is all I can\n",
      "tell you. You have made me very unhappy, and I never wish to see you\n",
      "again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Friends! Gossip! Newspaper misreports! Surely such things are not\n",
      "stronger than love! I can only believe that you never loved me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A blush drove the pallor from her face.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“You see, she doesn’t want to have anything to do with you,” Norman\n",
      "blurted out, starting on with her.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a long walk to North Oakland, but it was not until he went up\n",
      "the steps and entered his room that he knew he had walked it. He found\n",
      "himself sitting on the edge of the bed and staring about him like an\n",
      "awakened somnambulist. He noticed “Overdue” lying on the table and drew\n",
      "up his chair and reached for his pen. There was in his nature a logical\n",
      "compulsion toward completeness. Here was something undone. It had been\n",
      "deferred against the completion of something else. Now that something\n",
      "else had been finished, and he would apply himself to this task until\n",
      "it was finished. What he would do next he did not know. All that he did\n",
      "know was that a climacteric in his life had been attained. A period had\n",
      "been reached, and he was rounding it off in workman-like fashion. He\n",
      "was not curious about the future. He would soon enough find out what it\n",
      "held in store for him. Whatever it was, it did not matter. Nothing\n",
      "seemed to matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "For five days he toiled on at “Overdue,” going nowhere, seeing nobody,\n",
      "and eating meagrely. On the morning of the sixth day the postman\n",
      "brought him a thin letter from the editor of _The Parthenon_. A glance\n",
      "told him that “Ephemera” was accepted. “We have submitted the poem to\n",
      "Mr. Cartwright Bruce,” the editor went on to say, “and he has reported\n",
      "so favorably upon it that we cannot let it go. As an earnest of our\n",
      "pleasure in publishing the poem, let me tell you that we have set it\n",
      "for the August number, our July number being already made up. Kindly\n",
      "extend our pleasure and our thanks to Mr. Brissenden. Please send by\n",
      "return mail his photograph and biographical data. If our honorarium is\n",
      "unsatisfactory, kindly telegraph us at once and state what you consider\n",
      "a fair price.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the honorarium they had offered was three hundred and fifty\n",
      "dollars, Martin thought it not worth while to telegraph. Then, too,\n",
      "there was Brissenden’s consent to be gained. Well, he had been right,\n",
      "after all. Here was one magazine editor who knew real poetry when he\n",
      "saw it. And the price was splendid, even though it was for the poem of\n",
      "a century. As for Cartwright Bruce, Martin knew that he was the one\n",
      "critic for whose opinions Brissenden had any respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin rode down town on an electric car, and as he watched the houses\n",
      "and cross-streets slipping by he was aware of a regret that he was not\n",
      "more elated over his friend’s success and over his own signal victory.\n",
      "The one critic in the United States had pronounced favorably on the\n",
      "poem, while his own contention that good stuff could find its way into\n",
      "the magazines had proved correct. But enthusiasm had lost its spring in\n",
      "him, and he found that he was more anxious to see Brissenden than he\n",
      "was to carry the good news. The acceptance of _The Parthenon_ had\n",
      "recalled to him that during his five days’ devotion to “Overdue” he had\n",
      "not heard from Brissenden nor even thought about him. For the first\n",
      "time Martin realized the daze he had been in, and he felt shame for\n",
      "having forgotten his friend. But even the shame did not burn very\n",
      "sharply. He was numb to emotions of any sort save the artistic ones\n",
      "concerned in the writing of “Overdue.” So far as other affairs were\n",

      "increased the power of it, though it necessitated twenty thousand\n",
      "additional words. It was not that there was any vital need that the\n",
      "thing should be well done, but that his artistic canons compelled him\n",
      "to do it well. He worked on in the daze, strangely detached from the\n",
      "world around him, feeling like a familiar ghost among these literary\n",
      "trappings of his former life. He remembered that some one had said that\n",
      "a ghost was the spirit of a man who was dead and who did not have sense\n",

      "it. He lay on his back, with closed eyes, and did not think at all,\n",
      "while the daze or stupor slowly welled up, saturating his\n",
      "consciousness. Half in delirium, he began muttering aloud the lines of\n",

      "listening anxiously outside his door, was perturbed by his monotonous\n",

      "from a steam jet, the air was filled with driven spray, there was a\n",
      "rush and rumble and long-echoing roar, and the canoe floated on the\n",

      "for it for a year and a half. He noted its amount apathetically. The\n",
      "old-time thrill at receiving a publisher’s check was gone. Unlike his\n",
      "earlier checks, this one was not pregnant with promise of great things\n",

      "checks at the bank down in Oakland, he bought ten dollars’ worth of\n",
      "postage stamps. The thought of going home to cook breakfast in his\n",
      "stuffy little room was repulsive to him. For the first time he refused\n",
      "to consider his debts. He knew that in his room he could manufacture a\n",
      "substantial breakfast at a cost of from fifteen to twenty cents. But,\n",
      "instead, he went into the Forum Café and ordered a breakfast that cost\n",
      "two dollars. He tipped the waiter a quarter, and spent fifty cents for\n",
      "a package of Egyptian cigarettes. It was the first time he had smoked\n",
      "since Ruth had asked him to stop. But he could see now no reason why he\n",
      "should not, and besides, he wanted to smoke. And what did the money\n",

      "brown papers and rolled forty cigarettes—but what of it? Money had no\n",

      "long hours in the quiet parks. He had no friends nor acquaintances, nor\n",
      "did he make any. He had no inclination. He was waiting for some\n",

      "Palmist”—the poem he had written to Marian. The editors and readers\n",
      "were back from their summer vacations, and manuscripts were being\n",
      "handled quickly. But Martin could not puzzle out what strange whim\n",
      "animated them to this general acceptance of the things they had\n",
      "persistently rejected for two years. Nothing of his had been published.\n",
      "He was not known anywhere outside of Oakland, and in Oakland, with the\n",
      "few who thought they knew him, he was notorious as a red-shirt and a\n",

      "actually opened a bank account, where, without a debt in the world, he\n",
      "had several hundred dollars to his credit. “Overdue,” after having been\n",

      "check for that amount, accompanied by a contract, came by return mail.\n",
      "He cashed the check into five-dollar gold pieces and telephoned\n",
      "Gertrude that he wanted to see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She arrived at the house panting and short of breath from the haste she\n",
      "had made. Apprehensive of trouble, she had stuffed the few dollars she\n",
      "possessed into her hand-satchel; and so sure was she that disaster had\n",
      "overtaken her brother, that she stumbled forward, sobbing, into his\n",
      "arms, at the same time thrusting the satchel mutely at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d have come myself,” he said. “But I didn’t want a row with Mr.\n",
      "Higginbotham, and that is what would have surely happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’ll be all right after a time,” she assured him, while she wondered\n",
      "what the trouble was that Martin was in. “But you’d best get a job\n",
      "first an’ steady down. Bernard does like to see a man at honest work.\n",
      "That stuff in the newspapers broke ’m all up. I never saw ’m so mad\n",
      "before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not going to get a job,” Martin said with a smile. “And you can\n",
      "tell him so from me. I don’t need a job, and there’s the proof of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He emptied the hundred gold pieces into her lap in a glinting, tinkling\n",

      "of the same size.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If Gertrude had been frightened when she arrived, she was now in a\n",
      "panic of fear. Her fear was such that it was certitude. She was not\n",
      "suspicious. She was convinced. She looked at Martin in horror, and her\n",
      "heavy limbs shrank under the golden stream as though it were burning\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s yours,” he laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She burst into tears, and began to moan, “My poor boy, my poor boy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was puzzled for a moment. Then he divined the cause of her agitation\n",
      "and handed her the Meredith-Lowell letter which had accompanied the\n",
      "check. She stumbled through it, pausing now and again to wipe her eyes,\n",
      "and when she had finished, said:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“An’ does it mean that you come by the money honestly?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“More honestly than if I’d won it in a lottery. I earned it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly faith came back to her, and she reread the letter carefully. It\n",
      "took him long to explain to her the nature of the transaction which had\n",
      "put the money into his possession, and longer still to get her to\n",
      "understand that the money was really hers and that he did not need it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll put it in the bank for you,” she said finally.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll do nothing of the sort. It’s yours, to do with as you please,\n",
      "and if you won’t take it, I’ll give it to Maria. She’ll know what to do\n",
      "with it. I’d suggest, though, that you hire a servant and take a good\n",
      "long rest.”\n",

      "\n",
      "One day Martin became aware that he was lonely. He was healthy and\n",
      "strong, and had nothing to do. The cessation from writing and studying,\n",
      "the death of Brissenden, and the estrangement from Ruth had made a big\n",
      "hole in his life; and his life refused to be pinned down to good living\n",
      "in cafés and the smoking of Egyptian cigarettes. It was true the South\n",
      "Seas were calling to him, but he had a feeling that the game was not\n",
      "yet played out in the United States. Two books were soon to be\n",
      "published, and he had more books that might find publication. Money\n",
      "could be made out of them, and he would wait and take a sackful of it\n",
      "into the South Seas. He knew a valley and a bay in the Marquesas that\n",
      "he could buy for a thousand Chili dollars. The valley ran from the\n",
      "horseshoe, land-locked bay to the tops of the dizzy, cloud-capped peaks\n",
      "and contained perhaps ten thousand acres. It was filled with tropical\n",
      "fruits, wild chickens, and wild pigs, with an occasional herd of wild\n",
      "cattle, while high up among the peaks were herds of wild goats harried\n",
      "by packs of wild dogs. The whole place was wild. Not a human lived in\n",
      "it. And he could buy it and the bay for a thousand Chili dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bay, as he remembered it, was magnificent, with water deep enough\n",
      "to accommodate the largest vessel afloat, and so safe that the South\n",
      "Pacific Directory recommended it as the best careening place for ships\n",
      "for hundreds of miles around. He would buy a schooner—one of those\n",
      "yacht-like, coppered crafts that sailed like witches—and go trading\n",
      "copra and pearling among the islands. He would make the valley and the\n",
      "bay his headquarters. He would build a patriarchal grass house like\n",
      "Tati’s, and have it and the valley and the schooner filled with\n",
      "dark-skinned servitors. He would entertain there the factor of Taiohae,\n",
      "captains of wandering traders, and all the best of the South Pacific\n",
      "riffraff. He would keep open house and entertain like a prince. And he\n",
      "would forget the books he had opened and the world that had proved an\n",
      "illusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do all this he must wait in California to fill the sack with money.\n",
      "Already it was beginning to flow in. If one of the books made a strike,\n",
      "it might enable him to sell the whole heap of manuscripts. Also he\n",
      "could collect the stories and the poems into books, and make sure of\n",
      "the valley and the bay and the schooner. He would never write again.\n",
      "Upon that he was resolved. But in the meantime, awaiting the\n",
      "publication of the books, he must do something more than live dazed and\n",
      "stupid in the sort of uncaring trance into which he had fallen.\n",
      "\n",
      "He noted, one Sunday morning, that the Bricklayers’ Picnic took place\n",
      "that day at Shell Mound Park, and to Shell Mound Park he went. He had\n",
      "been to the working-class picnics too often in his earlier life not to\n",
      "know what they were like, and as he entered the park he experienced a\n",
      "recrudescence of all the old sensations. After all, they were his kind,\n",
      "these working people. He had been born among them, he had lived among\n",
      "them, and though he had strayed for a time, it was well to come back\n",
      "among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it ain’t Mart!” he heard some one say, and the next moment a hearty\n",
      "hand was on his shoulder. “Where you ben all the time? Off to sea? Come\n",
      "on an’ have a drink.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the old crowd in which he found himself—the old crowd, with here\n",
      "and there a gap, and here and there a new face. The fellows were not\n",
      "bricklayers, but, as in the old days, they attended all Sunday picnics\n",
      "for the dancing, and the fighting, and the fun. Martin drank with them,\n",
      "and began to feel really human once more. He was a fool to have ever\n",
      "left them, he thought; and he was very certain that his sum of\n",
      "happiness would have been greater had he remained with them and let\n",
      "alone the books and the people who sat in the high places. Yet the beer\n",
      "seemed not so good as of yore. It didn’t taste as it used to taste.\n",
      "Brissenden had spoiled him for steam beer, he concluded, and wondered\n",
      "if, after all, the books had spoiled him for companionship with these\n",
      "friends of his youth. He resolved that he would not be so spoiled, and\n",
      "he went on to the dancing pavilion. Jimmy, the plumber, he met there,\n",
      "in the company of a tall, blond girl who promptly forsook him for\n",
      "Martin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gee, it’s like old times,” Jimmy explained to the gang that gave him\n",
      "the laugh as Martin and the blonde whirled away in a waltz. “An’ I\n",
      "don’t give a rap. I’m too damned glad to see ’m back. Watch ’m waltz,\n",
      "eh? It’s like silk. Who’d blame any girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Martin restored the blonde to Jimmy, and the three of them, with\n",
      "half a dozen friends, watched the revolving couples and laughed and\n",
      "joked with one another. Everybody was glad to see Martin back. No book\n",
      "of his been published; he carried no fictitious value in their eyes.\n",
      "They liked him for himself. He felt like a prince returned from excile,\n",
      "and his lonely heart burgeoned in the geniality in which it bathed. He\n",
      "made a mad day of it, and was at his best. Also, he had money in his\n",
      "pockets, and, as in the old days when he returned from sea with a\n",
      "pay-day, he made the money fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, on the dancing-floor, he saw Lizzie Connolly go by in the arms of\n",
      "a young workingman; and, later, when he made the round of the pavilion,\n",
      "he came upon her sitting by a refreshment table. Surprise and greetings\n",
      "over, he led her away into the grounds, where they could talk without\n",
      "shouting down the music. From the instant he spoke to her, she was his.\n",
      "He knew it. She showed it in the proud humility of her eyes, in every\n",
      "caressing movement of her proudly carried body, and in the way she hung\n",
      "upon his speech. She was not the young girl as he had known her. She\n",
      "was a woman, now, and Martin noted that her wild, defiant beauty had\n",
      "improved, losing none of its wildness, while the defiance and the fire\n",
      "seemed more in control. “A beauty, a perfect beauty,” he murmured\n",
      "admiringly under his breath. And he knew she was his, that all he had\n",
      "to do was to say “Come,” and she would go with him over the world\n",
      "wherever he led.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as the thought flashed through his brain he received a heavy blow\n",
      "on the side of his head that nearly knocked him down. It was a man’s\n",
      "fist, directed by a man so angry and in such haste that the fist had\n",
      "missed the jaw for which it was aimed. Martin turned as he staggered,\n",
      "and saw the fist coming at him in a wild swing. Quite as a matter of\n",
      "course he ducked, and the fist flew harmlessly past, pivoting the man\n",
      "who had driven it. Martin hooked with his left, landing on the pivoting\n",
      "man with the weight of his body behind the blow. The man went to the\n",
      "ground sidewise, leaped to his feet, and made a mad rush. Martin saw\n",
      "his passion-distorted face and wondered what could be the cause of the\n",
      "fellow’s anger. But while he wondered, he shot in a straight left, the\n",
      "weight of his body behind the blow. The man went over backward and fell\n",
      "in a crumpled heap. Jimmy and others of the gang were running toward\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin was thrilling all over. This was the old days with a vengeance,\n",
      "with their dancing, and their fighting, and their fun. While he kept a\n",
      "wary eye on his antagonist, he glanced at Lizzie. Usually the girls\n",
      "screamed when the fellows got to scrapping, but she had not screamed.\n",
      "She was looking on with bated breath, leaning slightly forward, so keen\n",
      "was her interest, one hand pressed to her breast, her cheek flushed,\n",
      "and in her eyes a great and amazed admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man had gained his feet and was struggling to escape the\n",
      "restraining arms that were laid on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She was waitin’ for me to come back!” he was proclaiming to all and\n",
      "sundry. “She was waitin’ for me to come back, an’ then that fresh guy\n",
      "comes buttin’ in. Let go o’ me, I tell yeh. I’m goin’ to fix ’m.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s eatin’ yer?” Jimmy was demanding, as he helped hold the young\n",
      "fellow back. “That guy’s Mart Eden. He’s nifty with his mits, lemme\n",
      "tell you that, an’ he’ll eat you alive if you monkey with ’m.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He can’t steal her on me that way,” the other interjected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He licked the Flyin’ Dutchman, an’ you know _him_,” Jimmy went on\n",
      "expostulating. “An’ he did it in five rounds. You couldn’t last a\n",
      "minute against him. See?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This information seemed to have a mollifying effect, and the irate\n",
      "young man favored Martin with a measuring stare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He don’t look it,” he sneered; but the sneer was without passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s what the Flyin’ Dutchman thought,” Jimmy assured him. “Come on,\n",
      "now, let’s get outa this. There’s lots of other girls. Come on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The young fellow allowed himself to be led away toward the pavilion,\n",
      "and the gang followed after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is he?” Martin asked Lizzie. “And what’s it all about, anyway?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Already the zest of combat, which of old had been so keen and lasting,\n",
      "had died down, and he discovered that he was self-analytical, too much\n",
      "so to live, single heart and single hand, so primitive an existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lizzie tossed her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, he’s nobody,” she said. “He’s just ben keepin’ company with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had to, you see,” she explained after a pause. “I was gettin’ pretty\n",
      "lonesome. But I never forgot.” Her voice sank lower, and she looked\n",
      "straight before her. “I’d throw ’m down for you any time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin looking at her averted face, knowing that all he had to do was\n",
      "to reach out his hand and pluck her, fell to pondering whether, after\n",
      "all, there was any real worth in refined, grammatical English, and, so,\n",
      "forgot to reply to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You put it all over him,” she said tentatively, with a laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s a husky young fellow, though,” he admitted generously. “If they\n",
      "hadn’t taken him away, he might have given me my hands full.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who was that lady friend I seen you with that night?” she asked\n",
      "abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, just a lady friend,” was his answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a long time ago,” she murmured contemplatively. “It seems like\n",
      "a thousand years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Martin went no further into the matter. He led the conversation off\n",
      "into other channels. They had lunch in the restaurant, where he ordered\n",
      "wine and expensive delicacies and afterward he danced with her and with\n",
      "no one but her, till she was tired. He was a good dancer, and she\n",
      "whirled around and around with him in a heaven of delight, her head\n",
      "against his shoulder, wishing that it could last forever. Later in the\n",
      "afternoon they strayed off among the trees, where, in the good old\n",
      "fashion, she sat down while he sprawled on his back, his head in her\n",
      "lap. He lay and dozed, while she fondled his hair, looked down on his\n",
      "closed eyes, and loved him without reserve. Looking up suddenly, he\n",
      "read the tender advertisement in her face. Her eyes fluttered down,\n",
      "then they opened and looked into his with soft defiance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve kept straight all these years,” she said, her voice so low that\n",
      "it was almost a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his heart Martin knew that it was the miraculous truth. And at his\n",
      "heart pleaded a great temptation. It was in his power to make her\n",
      "happy. Denied happiness himself, why should he deny happiness to her?\n",
      "He could marry her and take her down with him to dwell in the\n",
      "grass-walled castle in the Marquesas. The desire to do it was strong,\n",
      "but stronger still was the imperative command of his nature not to do\n",
      "it. In spite of himself he was still faithful to Love. The old days of\n",
      "license and easy living were gone. He could not bring them back, nor\n",
      "could he go back to them. He was changed—how changed he had not\n",
      "realized until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not a marrying man, Lizzie,” he said lightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hand caressing his hair paused perceptibly, then went on with the\n",
      "same gentle stroke. He noticed her face harden, but it was with the\n",
      "hardness of resolution, for still the soft color was in her cheeks and\n",
      "she was all glowing and melting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did not mean that—” she began, then faltered. “Or anyway I don’t\n",
      "care.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t care,” she repeated. “I’m proud to be your friend. I’d do\n",
      "anything for you. I’m made that way, I guess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin sat up. He took her hand in his. He did it deliberately, with\n",
      "warmth but without passion; and such warmth chilled her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t let’s talk about it,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a great and noble woman,” he said. “And it is I who should be\n",
      "proud to know you. And I am, I am. You are a ray of light to me in a\n",
      "very dark world, and I’ve got to be straight with you, just as straight\n",
      "as you have been.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t care whether you’re straight with me or not. You could do\n",
      "anything with me. You could throw me in the dirt an’ walk on me. An’\n",
      "you’re the only man in the world that can,” she added with a defiant\n",
      "flash. “I ain’t taken care of myself ever since I was a kid for\n",
      "nothin’.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And it’s just because of that that I’m not going to,” he said gently.\n",
      "“You are so big and generous that you challenge me to equal\n",
      "generousness. I’m not marrying, and I’m not—well, loving without\n",
      "marrying, though I’ve done my share of that in the past. I’m sorry I\n",
      "came here to-day and met you. But it can’t be helped now, and I never\n",
      "expected it would turn out this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But look here, Lizzie. I can’t begin to tell you how much I like you.\n",
      "I do more than like you. I admire and respect you. You are magnificent,\n",
      "and you are magnificently good. But what’s the use of words? Yet\n",
      "there’s something I’d like to do. You’ve had a hard life; let me make\n",
      "it easy for you.” (A joyous light welled into her eyes, then faded out\n",
      "again.) “I’m pretty sure of getting hold of some money soon—lots of\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In that moment he abandoned the idea of the valley and the bay, the\n",
      "grass-walled castle and the trim, white schooner. After all, what did\n",
      "it matter? He could go away, as he had done so often, before the mast,\n",
      "on any ship bound anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d like to turn it over to you. There must be something you want—to\n",
      "go to school or business college. You might like to study and be a\n",
      "stenographer. I could fix it for you. Or maybe your father and mother\n",
      "are living—I could set them up in a grocery store or something.\n",
      "Anything you want, just name it, and I can fix it for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She made no reply, but sat, gazing straight before her, dry-eyed and\n",
      "motionless, but with an ache in the throat which Martin divined so\n",
      "strongly that it made his own throat ache. He regretted that he had\n",
      "spoken. It seemed so tawdry what he had offered her—mere money—compared\n",
      "with what she offered him. He offered her an extraneous thing with\n",
      "which he could part without a pang, while she offered him herself,\n",
      "along with disgrace and shame, and sin, and all her hopes of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t let’s talk about it,” she said with a catch in her voice that\n",
      "she changed to a cough. She stood up. “Come on, let’s go home. I’m all\n",
      "tired out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The day was done, and the merrymakers had nearly all departed. But as\n",
      "Martin and Lizzie emerged from the trees they found the gang waiting\n",
      "for them. Martin knew immediately the meaning of it. Trouble was\n",
      "brewing. The gang was his body-guard. They passed out through the gates\n",
      "of the park with, straggling in the rear, a second gang, the friends\n",
      "that Lizzie’s young man had collected to avenge the loss of his lady.\n",
      "Several constables and special police officers, anticipating trouble,\n",

      "Sixteenth Street Station and catch the electric car into Oakland.\n",
      "Lizzie was very quiet and without interest in what was impending. The\n",

      "for companionship remained unsatisfied. He had found no new home. As\n",
      "the gang could not understand him, as his own family could not\n",
      "understand him, as the bourgeoisie could not understand him, so this\n",

      "cords of the express package and the half-dozen complimentary copies\n",
      "from the publishers spilled out on the table, a heavy sadness fell upon\n",
      "him. He thought of the wild delight that would have been his had this\n",
      "happened a few short months before, and he contrasted that delight that\n",
      "should have been with his present uncaring coldness. His book, his\n",
      "first book, and his pulse had not gone up a fraction of a beat, and he\n",
      "was only sad. It meant little to him now. The most it meant was that it\n",
      "might bring some money, and little enough did he care for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "He carried a copy out into the kitchen and presented it to Maria.\n",

      "remember me by, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not bragging, not showing off. His sole motive was to make her\n",
      "happy, to make her proud of him, to justify her long faith in him. She\n",
      "put the book in the front room on top of the family Bible. A sacred\n",
      "thing was this book her lodger had made, a fetich of friendship. It\n",
      "softened the blow of his having been a laundryman, and though she could\n",
      "not understand a line of it, she knew that every line of it was great.\n",
      "She was a simple, practical, hard-working woman, but she possessed\n",
      "faith in large endowment.\n",

      "Just as emotionlessly as he had received “The Shame of the Sun” did he\n",
      "read the reviews of it that came in weekly from the clipping bureau.\n",
      "The book was making a hit, that was evident. It meant more gold in the\n",

      "not have been made at a more opportune moment. A fierce controversy was\n",

      "Crookes and Wallace ranged up on the opposing side, while Sir Oliver\n",

      "She thanked him incoherently, as if for a favor. And it was not until\n",
      "she had returned home to North Oakland and conferred with her own kind,\n",
      "and had the Portuguese grocer investigate, that she really knew that\n",
      "she was the owner of the little house in which she had lived and for\n",

      "each day was so many hours long, and, since he no longer was occupied\n",
      "with writing and studying, those hours had to be occupied somehow; so\n",
      "he yielded to what was to him a whim, permitted interviews, gave his\n",
      "opinions on literature and philosophy, and even accepted invitations of\n",
      "the bourgeoisie. He had settled down into a strange and comfortable\n",
      "state of mind. He no longer cared. He forgave everybody, even the cub\n",

      "Mr. Morse met Martin in the office of the Hotel Metropole. Whether he\n",
      "had happened there just casually, intent on other affairs, or whether\n",
      "he had come there for the direct purpose of inviting him to dinner,\n",
      "Martin never could quite make up his mind, though he inclined toward\n",
      "the second hypothesis. At any rate, invited to dinner he was by Mr.\n",
      "Morse—Ruth’s father, who had forbidden him the house and broken off the\n",
      "engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin was not angry. He was not even on his dignity. He tolerated Mr.\n",
      "Morse, wondering the while how it felt to eat such humble pie. He did\n",
      "not decline the invitation. Instead, he put it off with vagueness and\n",
      "indefiniteness and inquired after the family, particularly after Mrs.\n",
      "Morse and Ruth. He spoke her name without hesitancy, naturally, though\n",
      "secretly surprised that he had had no inward quiver, no old, familiar\n",
      "increase of pulse and warm surge of blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had many invitations to dinner, some of which he accepted. Persons\n",
      "got themselves introduced to him in order to invite him to dinner. And\n",
      "he went on puzzling over the little thing that was becoming a great\n",
      "thing. Bernard Higginbotham invited him to dinner. He puzzled the\n",
      "harder. He remembered the days of his desperate starvation when no one\n",
      "invited him to dinner. That was the time he needed dinners, and went\n",
      "weak and faint for lack of them and lost weight from sheer famine. That\n",
      "was the paradox of it. When he wanted dinners, no one gave them to him,\n",
      "and now that he could buy a hundred thousand dinners and was losing his\n",
      "appetite, dinners were thrust upon him right and left. But why? There\n",
      "was no justice in it, no merit on his part. He was no different. All\n",
      "the work he had done was even at that time work performed. Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Morse had condemned him for an idler and a shirk and through Ruth had\n",
      "urged that he take a clerk’s position in an office. Furthermore, they\n",
      "had been aware of his work performed. Manuscript after manuscript of\n",
      "his had been turned over to them by Ruth. They had read them. It was\n",
      "the very same work that had put his name in all the papers, and, it was\n",
      "his name being in all the papers that led them to invite him.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing was certain: the Morses had not cared to have him for himself\n",
      "or for his work. Therefore they could not want him now for himself or\n",
      "for his work, but for the fame that was his, because he was somebody\n",
      "amongst men, and—why not?—because he had a hundred thousand dollars or\n",
      "so. That was the way bourgeois society valued a man, and who was he to\n",
      "expect it otherwise? But he was proud. He disdained such valuation. He\n",
      "desired to be valued for himself, or for his work, which, after all,\n",
      "was an expression of himself. That was the way Lizzie valued him. The\n",
      "work, with her, did not even count. She valued him, himself. That was\n",
      "the way Jimmy, the plumber, and all the old gang valued him. That had\n",
      "been proved often enough in the days when he ran with them; it had been\n",
      "proved that Sunday at Shell Mound Park. His work could go hang. What\n",
      "they liked, and were willing to scrap for, was just Mart Eden, one of\n",
      "the bunch and a pretty good guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was Ruth. She had liked him for himself, that was\n",
      "indisputable. And yet, much as she had liked him she had liked the\n",
      "bourgeois standard of valuation more. She had opposed his writing, and\n",
      "principally, it seemed to him, because it did not earn money. That had\n",
      "been her criticism of his “Love-cycle.” She, too, had urged him to get\n",
      "a job. It was true, she refined it to “position,” but it meant the same\n",
      "thing, and in his own mind the old nomenclature stuck. He had read her\n",
      "all that he wrote—poems, stories, essays—“Wiki-Wiki,” “The Shame of the\n",
      "Sun,” everything. And she had always and consistently urged him to get\n",
      "a job, to go to work—good God!—as if he hadn’t been working, robbing\n",
      "sleep, exhausting life, in order to be worthy of her.\n",

      "So the little thing grew bigger. He was healthy and normal, ate\n",
      "regularly, slept long hours, and yet the growing little thing was\n",

      "He sat opposite Bernard Higginbotham at a heavy Sunday dinner over\n",
      "Higginbotham’s Cash Store, and it was all he could do to restrain\n",
      "himself from shouting out:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was work performed! And now you feed me, when then you let me\n",
      "starve, forbade me your house, and damned me because I wouldn’t get a\n",
      "job. And the work was already done, all done. And now, when I speak,\n",
      "you check the thought unuttered on your lips and hang on my lips and\n",
      "pay respectful attention to whatever I choose to say. I tell you your\n",
      "party is rotten and filled with grafters, and instead of flying into a\n",
      "rage you hum and haw and admit there is a great deal in what I say. And\n",
      "why? Because I’m famous; because I’ve a lot of money. Not because I’m\n",
      "Martin Eden, a pretty good fellow and not particularly a fool. I could\n",
      "tell you the moon is made of green cheese and you would subscribe to\n",
      "the notion, at least you would not repudiate it, because I’ve got\n",
      "dollars, mountains of them. And it was all done long ago; it was work\n",

      "he grew silent, Bernard Higginbotham got the reins and did the talking.\n",
      "He was a success himself, and proud of it. He was self-made. No one had\n",
      "helped him. He owed no man. He was fulfilling his duty as a citizen and\n",
      "bringing up a large family. And there was Higginbotham’s Cash Store,\n",
      "that monument of his own industry and ability. He loved Higginbotham’s\n",
      "Cash Store as some men loved their wives. He opened up his heart to\n",
      "Martin, showed with what keenness and with what enormous planning he\n",
      "had made the store. And he had plans for it, ambitious plans. The\n",
      "neighborhood was growing up fast. The store was really too small. If he\n",
      "had more room, he would be able to put in a score of labor-saving and\n",
      "money-saving improvements. And he would do it yet. He was straining\n",
      "every effort for the day when he could buy the adjoining lot and put up\n",
      "another two-story frame building. The upstairs he could rent, and the\n",
      "whole ground-floor of both buildings would be Higginbotham’s Cash\n",

      "\n",
      "Martin forgot to listen. The refrain of “Work performed,” in his own\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "consciousness disappeared. The five hundred women applauded softly with\n",
      "gloved hands, seeking to encourage the bashful great man who was their\n",
      "guest. And Martin shook the vision from his brain, smiled, and began to\n",
      "speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Superintendent of Schools, good old man, stopped Martin on the\n",
      "street and remembered him, recalling seances in his office when Martin\n",
      "was expelled from school for fighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I read your ‘Ring of Bells’ in one of the magazines quite a time ago,”\n",
      "he said. “It was as good as Poe. Splendid, I said at the time,\n",
      "splendid!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, and twice in the months that followed you passed me on the street\n",
      "and did not know me, Martin almost said aloud. Each time I was hungry\n",
      "and heading for the pawnbroker. Yet it was work performed. You did not\n",
      "know me then. Why do you know me now?\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was remarking to my wife only the other day,” the other was saying,\n",
      "“wouldn’t it be a good idea to have you out to dinner some time? And\n",
      "she quite agreed with me. Yes, she quite agreed with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dinner?” Martin said so sharply that it was almost a snarl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, yes, yes, dinner, you know—just pot luck with us, with your old\n",
      "superintendent, you rascal,” he uttered nervously, poking Martin in an\n",
      "attempt at jocular fellowship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin went down the street in a daze. He stopped at the corner and\n",
      "looked about him vacantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’ll be damned!” he murmured at last. “The old fellow was afraid\n",
      "of me.”\n",

      "CHAPTER XLV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Kreis came to Martin one day—Kreis, of the “real dirt”; and Martin\n",
      "turned to him with relief, to receive the glowing details of a scheme\n",
      "sufficiently wild-catty to interest him as a fictionist rather than an\n",
      "investor. Kreis paused long enough in the midst of his exposition to\n",
      "tell him that in most of his “Shame of the Sun” he had been a chump.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I didn’t come here to spout philosophy,” Kreis went on. “What I\n",
      "want to know is whether or not you will put a thousand dollars in on\n",
      "this deal?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I’m not chump enough for that, at any rate,” Martin answered. “But\n",
      "I’ll tell you what I will do. You gave me the greatest night of my\n",
      "life. You gave me what money cannot buy. Now I’ve got money, and it\n",
      "means nothing to me. I’d like to turn over to you a thousand dollars of\n",
      "what I don’t value for what you gave me that night and which was beyond\n",
      "price. You need the money. I’ve got more than I need. You want it. You\n",
      "came for it. There’s no use scheming it out of me. Take it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kreis betrayed no surprise. He folded the check away in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At that rate I’d like the contract of providing you with many such\n",
      "nights,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Too late.” Martin shook his head. “That night was the one night for\n",
      "me. I was in paradise. It’s commonplace with you, I know. But it wasn’t\n",
      "to me. I shall never live at such a pitch again. I’m done with\n",
      "philosophy. I want never to hear another word of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first dollar I ever made in my life out of my philosophy,” Kreis\n",
      "remarked, as he paused in the doorway. “And then the market broke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Morse drove by Martin on the street one day, and smiled and\n",
      "nodded. He smiled back and lifted his hat. The episode did not affect\n",
      "him. A month before it might have disgusted him, or made him curious\n",
      "and set him to speculating about her state of consciousness at that\n",
      "moment. But now it was not provocative of a second thought. He forgot\n",
      "about it the next moment. He forgot about it as he would have forgotten\n",
      "the Central Bank Building or the City Hall after having walked past\n",
      "them. Yet his mind was preternaturally active. His thoughts went ever\n",
      "around and around in a circle. The centre of that circle was “work\n",
      "performed”; it ate at his brain like a deathless maggot. He awoke to it\n",
      "in the morning. It tormented his dreams at night. Every affair of life\n",
      "around him that penetrated through his senses immediately related\n",
      "itself to “work performed.” He drove along the path of relentless logic\n",
      "to the conclusion that he was nobody, nothing. Mart Eden, the hoodlum,\n",
      "and Mart Eden, the sailor, had been real, had been he; but Martin Eden!\n",
      "the famous writer, did not exist. Martin Eden, the famous writer, was a\n",
      "vapor that had arisen in the mob-mind and by the mob-mind had been\n",
      "thrust into the corporeal being of Mart Eden, the hoodlum and sailor.\n",
      "But it couldn’t fool him. He was not that sun-myth that the mob was\n",
      "worshipping and sacrificing dinners to. He knew better.\n",
      "\n",
      "He read the magazines about himself, and pored over portraits of\n",
      "himself published therein until he was unable to associate his identity\n",
      "with those portraits. He was the fellow who had lived and thrilled and\n",
      "loved; who had been easy-going and tolerant of the frailties of life;\n",
      "who had served in the forecastle, wandered in strange lands, and led\n",
      "his gang in the old fighting days. He was the fellow who had been\n",
      "stunned at first by the thousands of books in the free library, and who\n",
      "had afterward learned his way among them and mastered them; he was the\n",
      "fellow who had burned the midnight oil and bedded with a spur and\n",
      "written books himself. But the one thing he was not was that colossal\n",
      "appetite that all the mob was bent upon feeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were things, however, in the magazines that amused him. All the\n",
      "magazines were claiming him. _Warren’s Monthly_ advertised to its\n",
      "subscribers that it was always on the quest after new writers, and\n",
      "that, among others, it had introduced Martin Eden to the reading\n",
      "public. _The White Mouse_ claimed him; so did _The Northern Review_ and\n",
      "_Mackintosh’s Magazine_, until silenced by _The Globe_, which pointed\n",
      "triumphantly to its files where the mangled “Sea Lyrics” lay buried.\n",
      "_Youth and Age_, which had come to life again after having escaped\n",
      "paying its bills, put in a prior claim, which nobody but farmers’\n",
      "children ever read. The _Transcontinental_ made a dignified and\n",
      "convincing statement of how it first discovered Martin Eden, which was\n",
      "warmly disputed by _The Hornet_, with the exhibit of “The Peri and the\n",
      "Pearl.” The modest claim of Singletree, Darnley & Co. was lost in the\n",
      "din. Besides, that publishing firm did not own a magazine wherewith to\n",
      "make its claim less modest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newspapers calculated Martin’s royalties. In some way the\n",
      "magnificent offers certain magazines had made him leaked out, and\n",
      "Oakland ministers called upon him in a friendly way, while professional\n",
      "begging letters began to clutter his mail. But worse than all this were\n",
      "the women. His photographs were published broadcast, and special\n",
      "writers exploited his strong, bronzed face, his scars, his heavy\n",
      "shoulders, his clear, quiet eyes, and the slight hollows in his cheeks\n",
      "like an ascetic’s. At this last he remembered his wild youth and\n",
      "smiled. Often, among the women he met, he would see now one, now\n",
      "another, looking at him, appraising him, selecting him. He laughed to\n",
      "himself. He remembered Brissenden’s warning and laughed again. The\n",
      "women would never destroy him, that much was certain. He had gone past\n",
      "that stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, walking with Lizzie toward night school, she caught a glance\n",
      "directed toward him by a well-gowned, handsome woman of the\n",
      "bourgeoisie. The glance was a trifle too long, a shade too\n",
      "considerative. Lizzie knew it for what it was, and her body tensed\n",
      "angrily. Martin noticed, noticed the cause of it, told her how used he\n",
      "was becoming to it and that he did not care anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to care,” she answered with blazing eyes. “You’re sick.\n",
      "That’s what’s the matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never healthier in my life. I weigh five pounds more than I ever did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain’t your body. It’s your head. Something’s wrong with your\n",
      "think-machine. Even I can see that, an’ I ain’t nobody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked on beside her, reflecting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d give anything to see you get over it,” she broke out impulsively.\n",
      "“You ought to care when women look at you that way, a man like you.\n",
      "It’s not natural. It’s all right enough for sissy-boys. But you ain’t\n",
      "made that way. So help me, I’d be willing an’ glad if the right woman\n",
      "came along an’ made you care.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he left Lizzie at night school, he returned to the Metropole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once in his rooms, he dropped into a Morris chair and sat staring\n",
      "straight before him. He did not doze. Nor did he think. His mind was a\n",
      "blank, save for the intervals when unsummoned memory pictures took form\n",
      "and color and radiance just under his eyelids. He saw these pictures,\n",
      "but he was scarcely conscious of them—no more so than if they had been\n",
      "dreams. Yet he was not asleep. Once, he roused himself and glanced at\n",
      "his watch. It was just eight o’clock. He had nothing to do, and it was\n",
      "too early for bed. Then his mind went blank again, and the pictures\n",
      "began to form and vanish under his eyelids. There was nothing\n",
      "distinctive about the pictures. They were always masses of leaves and\n",
      "shrub-like branches shot through with hot sunshine.\n",
      "\n",
      "A knock at the door aroused him. He was not asleep, and his mind\n",
      "immediately connected the knock with a telegram, or letter, or perhaps\n",
      "one of the servants bringing back clean clothes from the laundry. He\n",
      "was thinking about Joe and wondering where he was, as he said, “Come\n",
      "in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was still thinking about Joe, and did not turn toward the door. He\n",
      "heard it close softly. There was a long silence. He forgot that there\n",
      "had been a knock at the door, and was still staring blankly before him\n",
      "when he heard a woman’s sob. It was involuntary, spasmodic, checked,\n",
      "and stifled—he noted that as he turned about. The next instant he was\n",
      "on his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ruth!” he said, amazed and bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face was white and strained. She stood just inside the door, one\n",
      "hand against it for support, the other pressed to her side. She\n",
      "extended both hands toward him piteously, and started forward to meet\n",
      "him. As he caught her hands and led her to the Morris chair he noticed\n",
      "how cold they were. He drew up another chair and sat down on the broad\n",
      "arm of it. He was too confused to speak. In his own mind his affair\n",
      "with Ruth was closed and sealed. He felt much in the same way that he\n",
      "would have felt had the Shelly Hot Springs Laundry suddenly invaded the\n",
      "Hotel Metropole with a whole week’s washing ready for him to pitch\n",
      "into. Several times he was about to speak, and each time he hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one knows I am here,” Ruth said in a faint voice, with an appealing\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was surprised at the sound of his own voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "She repeated her words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” he said, then wondered what more he could possibly say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw you come in, and I waited a few minutes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” he said again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had never been so tongue-tied in his life. Positively he did not\n",
      "have an idea in his head. He felt stupid and awkward, but for the life\n",
      "of him he could think of nothing to say. It would have been easier had\n",
      "the intrusion been the Shelly Hot Springs laundry. He could have rolled\n",
      "up his sleeves and gone to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then you came in,” he said finally.\n",
      "\n",
      "She nodded, with a slightly arch expression, and loosened the scarf at\n",
      "her throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw you first from across the street when you were with that girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes,” he said simply. “I took her down to night school.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, aren’t you glad to see me?” she said at the end of another\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes.” He spoke hastily. “But wasn’t it rash of you to come here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I slipped in. Nobody knows I am here. I wanted to see you. I came to\n",
      "tell you I have been very foolish. I came because I could no longer\n",
      "stay away, because my heart compelled me to come, because—because I\n",
      "wanted to come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She came forward, out of her chair and over to him. She rested her hand\n",
      "on his shoulder a moment, breathing quickly, and then slipped into his\n",
      "arms. And in his large, easy way, desirous of not inflicting hurt,\n",
      "knowing that to repulse this proffer of herself was to inflict the most\n",
      "grievous hurt a woman could receive, he folded his arms around her and\n",
      "held her close. But there was no warmth in the embrace, no caress in\n",
      "the contact. She had come into his arms, and he held her, that was all.\n",
      "She nestled against him, and then, with a change of position, her hands\n",
      "crept up and rested upon his neck. But his flesh was not fire beneath\n",
      "those hands, and he felt awkward and uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What makes you tremble so?” he asked. “Is it a chill? Shall I light\n",
      "the grate?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made a movement to disengage himself, but she clung more closely to\n",
      "him, shivering violently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is merely nervousness,” she said with chattering teeth. “I’ll\n",
      "control myself in a minute. There, I am better already.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly her shivering died away. He continued to hold her, but he was no\n",
      "longer puzzled. He knew now for what she had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My mother wanted me to marry Charley Hapgood,” she announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Charley Hapgood, that fellow who speaks always in platitudes?” Martin\n",
      "groaned. Then he added, “And now, I suppose, your mother wants you to\n",
      "marry me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not put it in the form of a question. He stated it as a\n",
      "certitude, and before his eyes began to dance the rows of figures of\n",
      "his royalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She will not object, I know that much,” Ruth said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She considers me quite eligible?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruth nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet I am not a bit more eligible now than I was when she broke our\n",
      "engagement,” he meditated. “I haven’t changed any. I’m the same Martin\n",
      "Eden, though for that matter I’m a bit worse—I smoke now. Don’t you\n",
      "smell my breath?”\n",
      "\n",
      "In reply she pressed her open fingers against his lips, placed them\n",
      "graciously and playfully, and in expectancy of the kiss that of old had\n",
      "always been a consequence. But there was no caressing answer of\n",
      "Martin’s lips. He waited until the fingers were removed and then went\n",
      "on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not changed. I haven’t got a job. I’m not looking for a job.\n",
      "Furthermore, I am not going to look for a job. And I still believe that\n",
      "Herbert Spencer is a great and noble man and that Judge Blount is an\n",
      "unmitigated ass. I had dinner with him the other night, so I ought to\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you didn’t accept father’s invitation,” she chided.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you know about that? Who sent him? Your mother?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She remained silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then she did send him. I thought so. And now I suppose she has sent\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one knows that I am here,” she protested. “Do you think my mother\n",
      "would permit this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’d permit you to marry me, that’s certain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave a sharp cry. “Oh, Martin, don’t be cruel. You have not kissed\n",
      "me once. You are as unresponsive as a stone. And think what I have\n",
      "dared to do.” She looked about her with a shiver, though half the look\n",
      "was curiosity. “Just think of where I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I could die for you! I could die for you_!”—Lizzie’s words were\n",
      "ringing in his ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why didn’t you dare it before?” he asked harshly. “When I hadn’t a\n",
      "job? When I was starving? When I was just as I am now, as a man, as an\n",
      "artist, the same Martin Eden? That’s the question I’ve been propounding\n",
      "to myself for many a day—not concerning you merely, but concerning\n",
      "everybody. You see I have not changed, though my sudden apparent\n",
      "appreciation in value compels me constantly to reassure myself on that\n",
      "point. I’ve got the same flesh on my bones, the same ten fingers and\n",
      "toes. I am the same. I have not developed any new strength nor virtue.\n",
      "My brain is the same old brain. I haven’t made even one new\n",
      "generalization on literature or philosophy. I am personally of the same\n",
      "value that I was when nobody wanted me. And what is puzzling me is why\n",
      "they want me now. Surely they don’t want me for myself, for myself is\n",
      "the same old self they did not want. Then they must want me for\n",
      "something else, for something that is outside of me, for something that\n",
      "is not I! Shall I tell you what that something is? It is for the\n",
      "recognition I have received. That recognition is not I. It resides in\n",
      "the minds of others. Then again for the money I have earned and am\n",
      "earning. But that money is not I. It resides in banks and in the\n",
      "pockets of Tom, Dick, and Harry. And is it for that, for the\n",
      "recognition and the money, that you now want me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are breaking my heart,” she sobbed. “You know I love you, that I\n",
      "am here because I love you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid you don’t see my point,” he said gently. “What I mean is:\n",
      "if you love me, how does it happen that you love me now so much more\n",
      "than you did when your love was weak enough to deny me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forget and forgive,” she cried passionately. “I loved you all the\n",
      "time, remember that, and I am here, now, in your arms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I am a shrewd merchant, peering into the scales, trying to\n",
      "weigh your love and find out what manner of thing it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She withdrew herself from his arms, sat upright, and looked at him long\n",
      "and searchingly. She was about to speak, then faltered and changed her\n",
      "mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, it appears this way to me,” he went on. “When I was all that\n",
      "I am now, nobody out of my own class seemed to care for me. When my\n",
      "books were all written, no one who had read the manuscripts seemed to\n",
      "care for them. In point of fact, because of the stuff I had written\n",
      "they seemed to care even less for me. In writing the stuff it seemed\n",
      "that I had committed acts that were, to say the least, derogatory. ‘Get\n",
      "a job,’ everybody said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She made a movement of dissent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes,” he said; “except in your case you told me to get a\n",
      "position. The homely word _job_, like much that I have written, offends\n",
      "you. It is brutal. But I assure you it was no less brutal to me when\n",
      "everybody I knew recommended it to me as they would recommend right\n",
      "conduct to an immoral creature. But to return. The publication of what\n",
      "I had written, and the public notice I received, wrought a change in\n",
      "the fibre of your love. Martin Eden, with his work all performed, you\n",
      "would not marry. Your love for him was not strong enough to enable you\n",
      "to marry him. But your love is now strong enough, and I cannot avoid\n",
      "the conclusion that its strength arises from the publication and the\n",

      "certain that they apply to the change wrought in your mother and\n",

      "it makes me question love, sacred love. Is love so gross a thing that\n",
      "it must feed upon publication and public notice? It would seem so. I\n",
      "have sat and thought upon it till my head went around.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor, dear head.” She reached up a hand and passed the fingers\n",
      "soothingly through his hair. “Let it go around no more. Let us begin\n",
      "anew, now. I loved you all the time. I know that I was weak in yielding\n",
      "to my mother’s will. I should not have done so. Yet I have heard you\n",
      "speak so often with broad charity of the fallibility and frailty of\n",
      "humankind. Extend that charity to me. I acted mistakenly. Forgive me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I do forgive,” he said impatiently. “It is easy to forgive where\n",
      "there is really nothing to forgive. Nothing that you have done requires\n",
      "forgiveness. One acts according to one’s lights, and more than that one\n",
      "cannot do. As well might I ask you to forgive me for my not getting a\n",
      "job.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I meant well,” she protested. “You know that I could not have loved\n",
      "you and not meant well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“True; but you would have destroyed me out of your well-meaning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes,” he shut off her attempted objection. “You would have\n",
      "destroyed my writing and my career. Realism is imperative to my nature,\n",
      "and the bourgeois spirit hates realism. The bourgeoisie is cowardly. It\n",
      "is afraid of life. And all your effort was to make me afraid of life.\n",
      "You would have formalized me. You would have compressed me into a\n",
      "two-by-four pigeonhole of life, where all life’s values are unreal, and\n",
      "false, and vulgar.” He felt her stir protestingly. “Vulgarity—a hearty\n",
      "vulgarity, I’ll admit—is the basis of bourgeois refinement and culture.\n",
      "As I say, you wanted to formalize me, to make me over into one of your\n",
      "own class, with your class-ideals, class-values, and class-prejudices.”\n",
      "He shook his head sadly. “And you do not understand, even now, what I\n",
      "am saying. My words do not mean to you what I endeavor to make them\n",
      "mean. What I say is so much fantasy to you. Yet to me it is vital\n",
      "reality. At the best you are a trifle puzzled and amused that this raw\n",
      "boy, crawling up out of the mire of the abyss, should pass judgment\n",
      "upon your class and call it vulgar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She leaned her head wearily against his shoulder, and her body shivered\n",
      "with recurrent nervousness. He waited for a time for her to speak, and\n",
      "then went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now you want to renew our love. You want us to be married. You\n",
      "want me. And yet, listen—if my books had not been noticed, I’d\n",

      "away. It is all those damned books—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t swear,” she interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her reproof startled him. He broke into a harsh laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s it,” he said, “at a high moment, when what seems your life’s\n",
      "happiness is at stake, you are afraid of life in the same old\n",
      "way—afraid of life and a healthy oath.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was stung by his words into realization of the puerility of her\n",
      "act, and yet she felt that he had magnified it unduly and was\n",
      "consequently resentful. They sat in silence for a long time, she\n",
      "thinking desperately and he pondering upon his love which had departed.\n",
      "He knew, now, that he had not really loved her. It was an idealized\n",
      "Ruth he had loved, an ethereal creature of his own creating, the bright\n",
      "and luminous spirit of his love-poems. The real bourgeois Ruth, with\n",
      "all the bourgeois failings and with the hopeless cramp of the bourgeois\n",
      "psychology in her mind, he had never loved.\n",
      "\n",
      "She suddenly began to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that much you have said is so. I have been afraid of life. I\n",
      "did not love you well enough. I have learned to love better. I love you\n",
      "for what you are, for what you were, for the ways even by which you\n",
      "have become. I love you for the ways wherein you differ from what you\n",
      "call my class, for your beliefs which I do not understand but which I\n",
      "know I can come to understand. I shall devote myself to understanding\n",
      "them. And even your smoking and your swearing—they are part of you and\n",
      "I will love you for them, too. I can still learn. In the last ten\n",
      "minutes I have learned much. That I have dared to come here is a token\n",
      "of what I have already learned. Oh, Martin!—”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was sobbing and nestling close against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time his arms folded her gently and with sympathy, and\n",
      "she acknowledged it with a happy movement and a brightening face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is too late,” he said. He remembered Lizzie’s words. “I am a sick\n",
      "man—oh, not my body. It is my soul, my brain. I seem to have lost all\n",
      "values. I care for nothing. If you had been this way a few months ago,\n",
      "it would have been different. It is too late, now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not too late,” she cried. “I will show you. I will prove to you\n",
      "that my love has grown, that it is greater to me than my class and all\n",
      "that is dearest to me. All that is dearest to the bourgeoisie I will\n",
      "flout. I am no longer afraid of life. I will leave my father and\n",
      "mother, and let my name become a by-word with my friends. I will come\n",
      "to you here and now, in free love if you will, and I will be proud and\n",
      "glad to be with you. If I have been a traitor to love, I will now, for\n",
      "love’s sake, be a traitor to all that made that earlier treason.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood before him, with shining eyes.\n",
      "\n",

      "Look at me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was splendid, he thought, looking at her. She had redeemed herself\n",
      "for all that she had lacked, rising up at last, true woman, superior to\n",
      "the iron rule of bourgeois convention. It was splendid, magnificent,\n",
      "desperate. And yet, what was the matter with him? He was not thrilled\n",
      "nor stirred by what she had done. It was splendid and magnificent only\n",
      "intellectually. In what should have been a moment of fire, he coldly\n",
      "appraised her. His heart was untouched. He was unaware of any desire\n",
      "for her. Again he remembered Lizzie’s words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sick, very sick,” he said with a despairing gesture. “How sick I\n",
      "did not know till now. Something has gone out of me. I have always been\n",
      "unafraid of life, but I never dreamed of being sated with life. Life\n",
      "has so filled me that I am empty of any desire for anything. If there\n",
      "were room, I should want you, now. You see how sick I am.”\n",

      "He leaned his head back and closed his eyes; and like a child, crying,\n",
      "that forgets its grief in watching the sunlight percolate through the\n",
      "tear-dimmed films over the pupils, so Martin forgot his sickness, the\n",
      "presence of Ruth, everything, in watching the masses of vegetation,\n",
      "shot through hotly with sunshine that took form and blazed against this\n",
      "background of his eyelids. It was not restful, that green foliage. The\n",
      "sunlight was too raw and glaring. It hurt him to look at it, and yet he\n",
      "looked, he knew not why.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was brought back to himself by the rattle of the door-knob. Ruth was\n",
      "at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How shall I get out?” she questioned tearfully. “I am afraid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, forgive me,” he cried, springing to his feet. “I’m not myself, you\n",
      "know. I forgot you were here.” He put his hand to his head. “You see,\n",
      "I’m not just right. I’ll take you home. We can go out by the servants’\n",
      "entrance. No one will see us. Pull down that veil and everything will\n",
      "be all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She clung to his arm through the dim-lighted passages and down the\n",
      "narrow stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am safe now,” she said, when they emerged on the sidewalk, at the\n",
      "same time starting to take her hand from his arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, I’ll see you home,” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, please don’t,” she objected. “It is unnecessary.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again she started to remove her hand. He felt a momentary curiosity.\n",
      "Now that she was out of danger she was afraid. She was in almost a\n",
      "panic to be quit of him. He could see no reason for it and attributed\n",
      "it to her nervousness. So he restrained her withdrawing hand and\n",
      "started to walk on with her. Halfway down the block, he saw a man in a\n",
      "long overcoat shrink back into a doorway. He shot a glance in as he\n",
      "passed by, and, despite the high turned-up collar, he was certain that\n",
      "he recognized Ruth’s brother, Norman.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the walk Ruth and Martin held little conversation. She was\n",
      "stunned. He was apathetic. Once, he mentioned that he was going away,\n",
      "back to the South Seas, and, once, she asked him to forgive her having\n",
      "come to him. And that was all. The parting at her door was\n",
      "conventional. They shook hands, said good night, and he lifted his hat.\n",
      "The door swung shut, and he lighted a cigarette and turned back for his\n",
      "hotel. When he came to the doorway into which he had seen Norman\n",
      "shrink, he stopped and looked in in a speculative humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She lied,” he said aloud. “She made believe to me that she had dared\n",
      "greatly, and all the while she knew the brother that brought her was\n",
      "waiting to take her back.” He burst into laughter. “Oh, these\n",
      "bourgeois! When I was broke, I was not fit to be seen with his sister.\n",
      "When I have a bank account, he brings her to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he swung on his heel to go on, a tramp, going in the same direction,\n",
      "begged him over his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, mister, can you give me a quarter to get a bed?” were the words.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was the voice that made Martin turn around. The next instant he\n",
      "had Joe by the hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“D’ye remember that time we parted at the Hot Springs?” the other was\n",
      "saying. “I said then we’d meet again. I felt it in my bones. An’ here\n",
      "we are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re looking good,” Martin said admiringly, “and you’ve put on\n",
      "weight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sure have.” Joe’s face was beaming. “I never knew what it was to\n",
      "live till I hit hoboin’. I’m thirty pounds heavier an’ feel tiptop all\n",
      "the time. Why, I was worked to skin an’ bone in them old days. Hoboin’\n",
      "sure agrees with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you’re looking for a bed just the same,” Martin chided, “and it’s\n",
      "a cold night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Huh? Lookin’ for a bed?” Joe shot a hand into his hip pocket and\n",
      "brought it out filled with small change. “That beats hard graft,” he\n",
      "exulted. “You just looked good; that’s why I battered you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin laughed and gave in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve several full-sized drunks right there,” he insinuated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe slid the money back into his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not in mine,” he announced. “No gettin’ oryide for me, though there\n",
      "ain’t nothin’ to stop me except I don’t want to. I’ve ben drunk once\n",
      "since I seen you last, an’ then it was unexpected, bein’ on an empty\n",
      "stomach. When I work like a beast, I drink like a beast. When I live\n",
      "like a man, I drink like a man—a jolt now an’ again when I feel like\n",
      "it, an’ that’s all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin arranged to meet him next day, and went on to the hotel. He\n",
      "paused in the office to look up steamer sailings. The _Mariposa_ sailed\n",
      "for Tahiti in five days.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Telephone over to-morrow and reserve a stateroom for me,” he told the\n",
      "clerk. “No deck-stateroom, but down below, on the weather-side,—the\n",
      "port-side, remember that, the port-side. You’d better write it down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Once in his room he got into bed and slipped off to sleep as gently as\n",
      "a child. The occurrences of the evening had made no impression on him.\n",
      "His mind was dead to impressions. The glow of warmth with which he met\n",
      "Joe had been most fleeting. The succeeding minute he had been bothered\n",
      "by the ex-laundryman’s presence and by the compulsion of conversation.\n",
      "That in five more days he sailed for his loved South Seas meant nothing\n",
      "to him. So he closed his eyes and slept normally and comfortably for\n",
      "eight uninterrupted hours. He was not restless. He did not change his\n",
      "position, nor did he dream. Sleep had become to him oblivion, and each\n",
      "day that he awoke, he awoke with regret. Life worried and bored him,\n",
      "and time was a vexation.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Say, Joe,” was his greeting to his old-time working-mate next morning,\n",
      "“there’s a Frenchman out on Twenty-eighth Street. He’s made a pot of\n",
      "money, and he’s going back to France. It’s a dandy, well-appointed,\n",
      "small steam laundry. There’s a start for you if you want to settle\n",
      "down. Here, take this; buy some clothes with it and be at this man’s\n",
      "office by ten o’clock. He looked up the laundry for me, and he’ll take\n",
      "you out and show you around. If you like it, and think it is worth the\n",
      "price—twelve thousand—let me know and it is yours. Now run along. I’m\n",
      "busy. I’ll see you later.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now look here, Mart,” the other said slowly, with kindling anger, “I\n",
      "come here this mornin’ to see you. Savve? I didn’t come here to get no\n",
      "laundry. I come here for a talk for old friends’ sake, and you shove a\n",
      "laundry at me. I tell you what you can do. You can take that laundry\n",
      "an’ go to hell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was out of the room when Martin caught him and whirled him around.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now look here, Joe,” he said; “if you act that way, I’ll punch your\n",
      "head. And for old friends’ sake I’ll punch it hard. Savve?—you will,\n",
      "will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe had clinched and attempted to throw him, and he was twisting and\n",
      "writhing out of the advantage of the other’s hold. They reeled about\n",
      "the room, locked in each other’s arms, and came down with a crash\n",
      "across the splintered wreckage of a wicker chair. Joe was underneath,\n",
      "with arms spread out and held and with Martin’s knee on his chest. He\n",
      "was panting and gasping for breath when Martin released him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now we’ll talk a moment,” Martin said. “You can’t get fresh with me. I\n",
      "want that laundry business finished first of all. Then you can come\n",
      "back and we’ll talk for old sake’s sake. I told you I was busy. Look at\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A servant had just come in with the morning mail, a great mass of\n",
      "letters and magazines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can I wade through that and talk with you? You go and fix up that\n",
      "laundry, and then we’ll get together.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” Joe admitted reluctantly. “I thought you was turnin’ me\n",
      "down, but I guess I was mistaken. But you can’t lick me, Mart, in a\n",
      "stand-up fight. I’ve got the reach on you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll put on the gloves sometime and see,” Martin said with a smile.\n",
      "\n",

      "see that reach? It’ll make you go a few.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin heaved a sigh of relief when the door closed behind the\n",
      "laundryman. He was becoming anti-social. Daily he found it a severer\n",
      "strain to be decent with people. Their presence perturbed him, and the\n",
      "effort of conversation irritated him. They made him restless, and no\n",
      "sooner was he in contact with them than he was casting about for\n",
      "excuses to get rid of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not proceed to attack his mail, and for a half hour he lolled in\n",
      "his chair, doing nothing, while no more than vague, half-formed\n",
      "thoughts occasionally filtered through his intelligence, or rather, at\n",
      "wide intervals, themselves constituted the flickering of his\n",
      "intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "He roused himself and began glancing through his mail. There were a\n",
      "dozen requests for autographs—he knew them at sight; there were\n",
      "professional begging letters; and there were letters from cranks,\n",
      "ranging from the man with a working model of perpetual motion, and the\n",
      "man who demonstrated that the surface of the earth was the inside of a\n",
      "hollow sphere, to the man seeking financial aid to purchase the\n",
      "Peninsula of Lower California for the purpose of communist\n",
      "colonization. There were letters from women seeking to know him, and\n",
      "over one such he smiled, for enclosed was her receipt for pew-rent,\n",
      "sent as evidence of her good faith and as proof of her respectability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Editors and publishers contributed to the daily heap of letters, the\n",
      "former on their knees for his manuscripts, the latter on their knees\n",
      "for his books—his poor disdained manuscripts that had kept all he\n",
      "possessed in pawn for so many dreary months in order to fund them in\n",
      "postage. There were unexpected checks for English serial rights and for\n",
      "advance payments on foreign translations. His English agent announced\n",
      "the sale of German translation rights in three of his books, and\n",
      "informed him that Swedish editions, from which he could expect nothing\n",
      "because Sweden was not a party to the Berne Convention, were already on\n",
      "the market. Then there was a nominal request for his permission for a\n",
      "Russian translation, that country being likewise outside the Berne\n",
      "Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned to the huge bundle of clippings which had come in from his\n",
      "press bureau, and read about himself and his vogue, which had become a\n",
      "furore. All his creative output had been flung to the public in one\n",
      "magnificent sweep. That seemed to account for it. He had taken the\n",
      "public off its feet, the way Kipling had, that time when he lay near to\n",
      "death and all the mob, animated by a mob-mind thought, began suddenly\n",
      "to read him. Martin remembered how that same world-mob, having read him\n",
      "and acclaimed him and not understood him in the least, had, abruptly, a\n",
      "few months later, flung itself upon him and torn him to pieces. Martin\n",
      "grinned at the thought. Who was he that he should not be similarly\n",
      "treated in a few more months? Well, he would fool the mob. He would be\n",
      "away, in the South Seas, building his grass house, trading for pearls\n",
      "and copra, jumping reefs in frail outriggers, catching sharks and\n",
      "bonitas, hunting wild goats among the cliffs of the valley that lay\n",
      "next to the valley of Taiohae.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the moment of that thought the desperateness of his situation dawned\n",
      "upon him. He saw, cleared eyed, that he was in the Valley of the\n",
      "Shadow. All the life that was in him was fading, fainting, making\n",
      "toward death.\n",
      "\n",
      "He realized how much he slept, and how much he desired to sleep. Of\n",
      "old, he had hated sleep. It had robbed him of precious moments of\n",
      "living. Four hours of sleep in the twenty-four had meant being robbed\n",
      "of four hours of life. How he had grudged sleep! Now it was life he\n",
      "grudged. Life was not good; its taste in his mouth was without tang,\n",
      "and bitter. This was his peril. Life that did not yearn toward life was\n",
      "in fair way toward ceasing. Some remote instinct for preservation\n",
      "stirred in him, and he knew he must get away. He glanced about the\n",
      "room, and the thought of packing was burdensome. Perhaps it would be\n",
      "better to leave that to the last. In the meantime he might be getting\n",
      "an outfit.\n",
      "\n",
      "He put on his hat and went out, stopping in at a gun-store, where he\n",
      "spent the remainder of the morning buying automatic rifles, ammunition,\n",
      "and fishing tackle. Fashions changed in trading, and he knew he would\n",
      "have to wait till he reached Tahiti before ordering his trade-goods.\n",
      "They could come up from Australia, anyway. This solution was a source\n",
      "of pleasure. He had avoided doing something, and the doing of anything\n",
      "just now was unpleasant. He went back to the hotel gladly, with a\n",
      "feeling of satisfaction in that the comfortable Morris chair was\n",
      "waiting for him; and he groaned inwardly, on entering his room, at\n",
      "sight of Joe in the Morris chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe was delighted with the laundry. Everything was settled, and he\n",
      "would enter into possession next day. Martin lay on the bed, with\n",
      "closed eyes, while the other talked on. Martin’s thoughts were far\n",
      "away—so far away that he was rarely aware that he was thinking. It was\n",
      "only by an effort that he occasionally responded. And yet this was Joe,\n",
      "whom he had always liked. But Joe was too keen with life. The\n",
      "boisterous impact of it on Martin’s jaded mind was a hurt. It was an\n",
      "aching probe to his tired sensitiveness. When Joe reminded him that\n",
      "sometime in the future they were going to put on the gloves together,\n",
      "he could almost have screamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remember, Joe, you’re to run the laundry according to those old rules\n",
      "you used to lay down at Shelly Hot Springs,” he said. “No overworking.\n",
      "No working at night. And no children at the mangles. No children\n",
      "anywhere. And a fair wage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe nodded and pulled out a note-book.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at here. I was workin’ out them rules before breakfast this A.M.\n",
      "What d’ye think of them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He read them aloud, and Martin approved, worrying at the same time as\n",
      "to when Joe would take himself off.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was late afternoon when he awoke. Slowly the fact of life came back\n",
      "to him. He glanced about the room. Joe had evidently stolen away after\n",
      "he had dozed off. That was considerate of Joe, he thought. Then he\n",
      "closed his eyes and slept again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the days that followed Joe was too busy organizing and taking hold\n",
      "of the laundry to bother him much; and it was not until the day before\n",
      "sailing that the newspapers made the announcement that he had taken\n",
      "passage on the _Mariposa_. Once, when the instinct of preservation\n",
      "fluttered, he went to a doctor and underwent a searching physical\n",
      "examination. Nothing could be found the matter with him. His heart and\n",
      "lungs were pronounced magnificent. Every organ, so far as the doctor\n",
      "could know, was normal and was working normally.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is nothing the matter with you, Mr. Eden,” he said, “positively\n",
      "nothing the matter with you. You are in the pink of condition.\n",
      "Candidly, I envy you your health. It is superb. Look at that chest.\n",
      "There, and in your stomach, lies the secret of your remarkable\n",
      "constitution. Physically, you are a man in a thousand—in ten thousand.\n",
      "Barring accidents, you should live to be a hundred.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Martin knew that Lizzie’s diagnosis had been correct. Physically he\n",
      "was all right. It was his “think-machine” that had gone wrong, and\n",
      "there was no cure for that except to get away to the South Seas. The\n",
      "trouble was that now, on the verge of departure, he had no desire to\n",
      "go. The South Seas charmed him no more than did bourgeois civilization.\n",
      "There was no zest in the thought of departure, while the act of\n",
      "departure appalled him as a weariness of the flesh. He would have felt\n",
      "better if he were already on board and gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last day was a sore trial. Having read of his sailing in the\n",
      "morning papers, Bernard Higginbotham, Gertrude, and all the family came\n",
      "to say good-by, as did Hermann von Schmidt and Marian. Then there was\n",
      "business to be transacted, bills to be paid, and everlasting reporters\n",
      "to be endured. He said good-by to Lizzie Connolly, abruptly, at the\n",
      "entrance to night school, and hurried away. At the hotel he found Joe,\n",
      "too busy all day with the laundry to have come to him earlier. It was\n",
      "the last straw, but Martin gripped the arms of his chair and talked and\n",
      "listened for half an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know, Joe,” he said, “that you are not tied down to that laundry.\n",
      "There are no strings on it. You can sell it any time and blow the\n",
      "money. Any time you get sick of it and want to hit the road, just pull\n",
      "out. Do what will make you the happiest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No more road in mine, thank you kindly. Hoboin’s all right, exceptin’\n",
      "for one thing—the girls. I can’t help it, but I’m a ladies’ man. I\n",
      "can’t get along without ’em, and you’ve got to get along without ’em\n",
      "when you’re hoboin’. The times I’ve passed by houses where dances an’\n",
      "parties was goin’ on, an’ heard the women laugh, an’ saw their white\n",
      "dresses and smiling faces through the windows—Gee! I tell you them\n",
      "moments was plain hell. I like dancin’ an’ picnics, an’ walking in the\n",
      "moonlight, an’ all the rest too well. Me for the laundry, and a good\n",
      "front, with big iron dollars clinkin’ in my jeans. I seen a girl\n",
      "already, just yesterday, and, d’ye know, I’m feelin’ already I’d just\n",
      "as soon marry her as not. I’ve ben whistlin’ all day at the thought of\n",
      "it. She’s a beaut, with the kindest eyes and softest voice you ever\n",
      "heard. Me for her, you can stack on that. Say, why don’t you get\n",
      "married with all this money to burn? You could get the finest girl in\n",
      "the land.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin shook his head with a smile, but in his secret heart he was\n",
      "wondering why any man wanted to marry. It seemed an amazing and\n",
      "incomprehensible thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the deck of the _Mariposa_, at the sailing hour, he saw Lizzie\n",
      "Connolly hiding in the skirts of the crowd on the wharf. Take her with\n",
      "you, came the thought. It is easy to be kind. She will be supremely\n",
      "happy. It was almost a temptation one moment, and the succeeding moment\n",
      "it became a terror. He was in a panic at the thought of it. His tired\n",
      "soul cried out in protest. He turned away from the rail with a groan,\n",
      "muttering, “Man, you are too sick, you are too sick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He fled to his stateroom, where he lurked until the steamer was clear\n",
      "of the dock. In the dining saloon, at luncheon, he found himself in the\n",
      "place of honor, at the captain’s right; and he was not long in\n",
      "discovering that he was the great man on board. But no more\n",
      "unsatisfactory great man ever sailed on a ship. He spent the afternoon\n",
      "in a deck-chair, with closed eyes, dozing brokenly most of the time,\n",
      "and in the evening went early to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the second day, recovered from seasickness, the full passenger\n",
      "list was in evidence, and the more he saw of the passengers the more he\n",
      "disliked them. Yet he knew that he did them injustice. They were good\n",
      "and kindly people, he forced himself to acknowledge, and in the moment\n",
      "of acknowledgment he qualified—good and kindly like all the\n",
      "bourgeoisie, with all the psychological cramp and intellectual futility\n",
      "of their kind, they bored him when they talked with him, their little\n",
      "superficial minds were so filled with emptiness; while the boisterous\n",
      "high spirits and the excessive energy of the younger people shocked\n",
      "him. They were never quiet, ceaselessly playing deck-quoits, tossing\n",
      "rings, promenading, or rushing to the rail with loud cries to watch the\n",
      "leaping porpoises and the first schools of flying fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "He slept much. After breakfast he sought his deck-chair with a magazine\n",
      "he never finished. The printed pages tired him. He puzzled that men\n",
      "found so much to write about, and, puzzling, dozed in his chair. When\n",
      "the gong awoke him for luncheon, he was irritated that he must awaken.\n",
      "There was no satisfaction in being awake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, he tried to arouse himself from his lethargy, and went forward\n",
      "into the forecastle with the sailors. But the breed of sailors seemed\n",
      "to have changed since the days he had lived in the forecastle. He could\n",
      "find no kinship with these stolid-faced, ox-minded bestial creatures.\n",
      "He was in despair. Up above nobody had wanted Martin Eden for his own\n",
      "sake, and he could not go back to those of his own class who had wanted\n",
      "him in the past. He did not want them. He could not stand them any more\n",
      "than he could stand the stupid first-cabin passengers and the riotous\n",
      "young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life was to him like strong, white light that hurts the tired eyes of a\n",
      "sick person. During every conscious moment life blazed in a raw glare\n",
      "around him and upon him. It hurt. It hurt intolerably. It was the first\n",
      "time in his life that Martin had travelled first class. On ships at sea\n",
      "he had always been in the forecastle, the steerage, or in the black\n",
      "depths of the coal-hold, passing coal. In those days, climbing up the\n",
      "iron ladders out the pit of stifling heat, he had often caught glimpses\n",
      "of the passengers, in cool white, doing nothing but enjoy themselves,\n",
      "under awnings spread to keep the sun and wind away from them, with\n",
      "subservient stewards taking care of their every want and whim, and it\n",
      "had seemed to him that the realm in which they moved and had their\n",
      "being was nothing else than paradise. Well, here he was, the great man\n",
      "on board, in the midmost centre of it, sitting at the captain’s right\n",
      "hand, and yet vainly harking back to forecastle and stoke-hole in quest\n",
      "of the Paradise he had lost. He had found no new one, and now he could\n",
      "not find the old one.\n",
      "\n",
      "He strove to stir himself and find something to interest him. He\n",
      "ventured the petty officers’ mess, and was glad to get away. He talked\n",
      "with a quartermaster off duty, an intelligent man who promptly prodded\n",
      "him with the socialist propaganda and forced into his hands a bunch of\n",
      "leaflets and pamphlets. He listened to the man expounding the\n",
      "slave-morality, and as he listened, he thought languidly of his own\n",
      "Nietzsche philosophy. But what was it worth, after all? He remembered\n",
      "one of Nietzsche’s mad utterances wherein that madman had doubted\n",
      "truth. And who was to say? Perhaps Nietzsche had been right. Perhaps\n",
      "there was no truth in anything, no truth in truth—no such thing as\n",
      "truth. But his mind wearied quickly, and he was content to go back to\n",
      "his chair and doze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miserable as he was on the steamer, a new misery came upon him. What\n",
      "when the steamer reached Tahiti? He would have to go ashore. He would\n",
      "have to order his trade-goods, to find a passage on a schooner to the\n",
      "Marquesas, to do a thousand and one things that were awful to\n",
      "contemplate. Whenever he steeled himself deliberately to think, he\n",
      "could see the desperate peril in which he stood. In all truth, he was\n",
      "in the Valley of the Shadow, and his danger lay in that he was not\n",
      "afraid. If he were only afraid, he would make toward life. Being\n",
      "unafraid, he was drifting deeper into the shadow. He found no delight\n",
      "in the old familiar things of life. The _Mariposa_ was now in the\n",
      "northeast trades, and this wine of wind, surging against him, irritated\n",
      "him. He had his chair moved to escape the embrace of this lusty comrade\n",
      "of old days and nights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day the _Mariposa_ entered the doldrums, Martin was more miserable\n",
      "than ever. He could no longer sleep. He was soaked with sleep, and\n",
      "perforce he must now stay awake and endure the white glare of life. He\n",
      "moved about restlessly. The air was sticky and humid, and the\n",
      "rain-squalls were unrefreshing. He ached with life. He walked around\n",
      "the deck until that hurt too much, then sat in his chair until he was\n",
      "compelled to walk again. He forced himself at last to finish the\n",
      "magazine, and from the steamer library he culled several volumes of\n",
      "poetry. But they could not hold him, and once more he took to walking.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stayed late on deck, after dinner, but that did not help him, for\n",
      "when he went below, he could not sleep. This surcease from life had\n",
      "failed him. It was too much. He turned on the electric light and tried\n",
      "to read. One of the volumes was a Swinburne. He lay in bed, glancing\n",
      "through its pages, until suddenly he became aware that he was reading\n",
      "with interest. He finished the stanza, attempted to read on, then came\n",
      "back to it. He rested the book face downward on his breast and fell to\n",
      "thinking. That was it. The very thing. Strange that it had never come\n",
      "to him before. That was the meaning of it all; he had been drifting\n",
      "that way all the time, and now Swinburne showed him that it was the\n",
      "happy way out. He wanted rest, and here was rest awaiting him. He\n",
      "glanced at the open port-hole. Yes, it was large enough. For the first\n",
      "time in weeks he felt happy. At last he had discovered the cure of his\n",
      "ill. He picked up the book and read the stanza slowly aloud:-\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘From too much love of living,\n",
      "    From hope and fear set free,\n",
      "We thank with brief thanksgiving\n",
      "    Whatever gods may be\n",
      "That no life lives forever;\n",
      "That dead men rise up never;\n",
      "    That even the weariest river\n",
      "    Winds somewhere safe to sea.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked again at the open port. Swinburne had furnished the key. Life\n",
      "was ill, or, rather, it had become ill—an unbearable thing. “That dead\n",
      "men rise up never!” That line stirred him with a profound feeling of\n",
      "gratitude. It was the one beneficent thing in the universe. When life\n",
      "became an aching weariness, death was ready to soothe away to\n",
      "everlasting sleep. But what was he waiting for? It was time to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "He arose and thrust his head out the port-hole, looking down into the\n",
      "milky wash. The _Mariposa_ was deeply loaded, and, hanging by his\n",
      "hands, his feet would be in the water. He could slip in noiselessly. No\n",
      "one would hear. A smother of spray dashed up, wetting his face. It\n",
      "tasted salt on his lips, and the taste was good. He wondered if he\n",
      "ought to write a swan-song, but laughed the thought away. There was no\n",
      "time. He was too impatient to be gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning off the light in his room so that it might not betray him, he\n",
      "went out the port-hole feet first. His shoulders stuck, and he forced\n",
      "himself back so as to try it with one arm down by his side. A roll of\n",
      "the steamer aided him, and he was through, hanging by his hands. When\n",
      "his feet touched the sea, he let go. He was in a milky froth of water.\n",
      "The side of the _Mariposa_ rushed past him like a dark wall, broken\n",
      "here and there by lighted ports. She was certainly making time. Almost\n",
      "before he knew it, he was astern, swimming gently on the foam-crackling\n",
      "surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bonita struck at his white body, and he laughed aloud. It had taken a\n",
      "piece out, and the sting of it reminded him of why he was there. In the\n",
      "work to do he had forgotten the purpose of it. The lights of the\n",
      "_Mariposa_ were growing dim in the distance, and there he was, swimming\n",
      "confidently, as though it were his intention to make for the nearest\n",
      "land a thousand miles or so away.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the automatic instinct to live. He ceased swimming, but the\n",
      "moment he felt the water rising above his mouth the hands struck out\n",
      "sharply with a lifting movement. The will to live, was his thought, and\n",
      "the thought was accompanied by a sneer. Well, he had will,—ay, will\n",
      "strong enough that with one last exertion it could destroy itself and\n",
      "cease to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "He changed his position to a vertical one. He glanced up at the quiet\n",
      "stars, at the same time emptying his lungs of air. With swift, vigorous\n",
      "propulsion of hands and feet, he lifted his shoulders and half his\n",
      "chest out of water. This was to gain impetus for the descent. Then he\n",
      "let himself go and sank without movement, a white statue, into the sea.\n",
      "He breathed in the water deeply, deliberately, after the manner of a\n",
      "man taking an anaesthetic. When he strangled, quite involuntarily his\n",
      "arms and legs clawed the water and drove him up to the surface and into\n",
      "the clear sight of the stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The will to live, he thought disdainfully, vainly endeavoring not to\n",
      "breathe the air into his bursting lungs. Well, he would have to try a\n",
      "new way. He filled his lungs with air, filled them full. This supply\n",
      "would take him far down. He turned over and went down head first,\n",
      "swimming with all his strength and all his will. Deeper and deeper he\n",
      "went. His eyes were open, and he watched the ghostly, phosphorescent\n",
      "trails of the darting bonita. As he swam, he hoped that they would not\n",
      "strike at him, for it might snap the tension of his will. But they did\n",
      "not strike, and he found time to be grateful for this last kindness of\n",
      "life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, he swam till his arms and legs grew tired and hardly moved.\n",
      "He knew that he was deep. The pressure on his ear-drums was a pain, and\n",
      "there was a buzzing in his head. His endurance was faltering, but he\n",
      "compelled his arms and legs to drive him deeper until his will snapped\n",
      "and the air drove from his lungs in a great explosive rush. The bubbles\n",
      "rubbed and bounded like tiny balloons against his cheeks and eyes as\n",
      "they took their upward flight. Then came pain and strangulation. This\n",
      "hurt was not death, was the thought that oscillated through his reeling\n",
      "consciousness. Death did not hurt. It was life, the pangs of life, this\n",
      "awful, suffocating feeling; it was the last blow life could deal him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wilful hands and feet began to beat and churn about, spasmodically\n",
      "and feebly. But he had fooled them and the will to live that made them\n",
      "beat and churn. He was too deep down. They could never bring him to the\n",
      "surface. He seemed floating languidly in a sea of dreamy vision. Colors\n",
      "and radiances surrounded him and bathed him and pervaded him. What was\n",
      "that? It seemed a lighthouse; but it was inside his brain—a flashing,\n",
      "bright white light. It flashed swifter and swifter. There was a long\n",
      "rumble of sound, and it seemed to him that he was falling down a vast\n",
      "and interminable stairway. And somewhere at the bottom he fell into\n",
      "darkness. That much he knew. He had fallen into darkness. And at the\n",
      "instant he knew, he ceased to know.\n",

       "'He walked at the other’s heels with a swing to his shoulders, and his\\nlegs spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting up and\\nsinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea. The wide rooms seemed\\ntoo narrow for his rolling gait, and to himself he was in terror lest\\nhis broad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the\\nbric-a-brac from the low mantel. He recoiled from side to side between\\nthe various objects and multiplied the hazards that in reality lodged\\nonly in his mind. Between a grand piano and a centre-table piled high\\nwith books was space for a half a dozen to walk abreast, yet he essayed\\nit with trepidation. His heavy arms hung loosely at his sides. He did\\nnot know what to do with those arms and hands, and when, to his excited\\nvision, one arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table,\\nhe lurched away like a frightened horse, barely missing the piano\\nstool. He watched the easy walk of the other in front of him, and for\\nthe first time realized that his walk was different from that of other\\nmen. He experienced a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so\\nuncouthly. The sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny\\nbeads, and he paused and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief.'"
